<p>Entry for YC121 New Eden Capsuleer’s Writing Contest in the Prose category.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>YC 121 Reign of Catiz I<br>
Location: 9UY4-H - Providence region.</p>
<p>Lord Vaari, the first hero and Lord of the amarrian loyalists hated this particular moment. The moment when warped tunnel of somewhat unknown space merges with real space…our space…the amarrian space.</p>
<p>He had done this thousands of times, but every time it causes slight nausea. In protein rich tank, Lord Vaari touches his stomach like every time this happens. Holographick instruments shows he to be in command deck like…real captains. Not like this indignifying capsule.</p>
<p>There is command deck. Even in these advanced ships. Command capsule is right next to it. To everyones pleasure, ship’s crew sees their captain sitting in his holographic command chair and their captain sees his crew like normal bridge of the spaceship. Of course every captain or “pilot” like some youngsters call modern captains, or “capsuleers” can dictate at will how their bridge is seen by crew. In any case. There is command bridge and there will always be a command bridge.</p>
<p>-We are through the warp, thank the God.<br>
Master of the bridge said.<br>
-My Lord, Multiple heretic contacts, scanning independent owned structures as you commanded. Your orders, my lord?<br>
He continued.</p>
<p>-<em>Warp to the jump bridge array. Scanners at full strength.</em><br>
Lord Vaari’s thoughts were made into voice.</p>
<p>Master of the bridge nodded again when command capsule audio repeaters formed the Lord Vaari’s thoughts to hearing form. Voice was real, like his Lordship would invoced them personally. Immence old age combimed with authority and self importance.</p>
<p>Only few second later TES Strawberry emmerges from the warp tunnel near CVA’s jump bridge array. Slighty further loomed their star fortress. Mighty Keepstar class construct, fully operational and majestic. Like immortal shrine dedicated for human creativity. Shining in sinister light the fortress stole everyones sight at his lordship’s thrice blessed ship.</p>
<p>Keepstars were dangerous and majestic beyond mortal comprehension. Their dominance were absolute and one keepstar could easily hold out hundreds of ships. With little help…thousands. Lord Vaari were here alone and his ship were small assault frigate. It was second generation amarrian frigate, but still a one ship. There were no doubt, for this was heretic territory. Deceivers, who make money by pretending to be loyalusts. This was the home of XHJFX the Terrible, who was and is holding tyrannical dominon over all of the CVA</p>
<p>-<em>God omnipotent is with us. Carry out your duties.</em><br>
Lord Vaari said. His crew continued their duties, but still glanced time to time at the great citadel, like making sure its mighty, unimaginable powerful arcing vorton projector is not charging. No matter if it would, they would never get away from it.</p>
<p>-<em>Alert! Alert! Alert! Heretic approaches!</em><br>
Computer declared. Not a two seconds passed, when crew were at their stations and started to assess the situation. Gun officers were calculating the optimal firing solutions, while engineering were organizing damage control teams to immediate action.</p>
<p>-My Lord. The enemy is GROUND XERO of the CVA. he command the Hawk-class and is approaching fast. Time of no retreat 6 seconds.<br>
Master of the bridge said.</p>
<p>-<em>We attack. We destroy him quickly and retreat.</em><br>
Lord Vaari said.</p>
<p>-As you command, my Lord.<br>
Master of the bridge nodded.</p>
<p>-Engines to full, lock the target and open fire. For God and the Empress, beloved by all!<br>
Master of the bridge commanded.</p>
<p>-<em>For the Empress, beloved by all!</em><br>
Exalted Lord made his thoughts heard.</p>
<p>-For house Valius! For the Empress! For the GOOOOD!<br>
Bridge crew yelled and stomped their legs to the floor. This strange ritual is only happening in small community of ancient amarr speaking language group. While inertia and sheer mass of the gold plated ship was enought to numb any human stomping, one could easily imagine the unified feet trembling the ship. The crew was ready. It was their moment to shine in front of their liege lord. It was their moment to advance the God’s holy plan.</p>
<p>Two ships approached each others in the great emptiness of space. Golden amarrian frigate, blessed by prayers, sacred waters and holy oils. Other was dark metal of caldari design. Utterly corrupted by the shadows that now hold Providence as its domain. Ships soon to meet in deadly space warfare.</p>
<p>-<em>Gamma crystals, open fire. Pray for our survival</em><br>
Lord Vaari said.</p>
<p>-You heard his lordships! ON THE DOUBLE!<br>
Master of the bridge yelled. sweat were forming on his forehead, but he resisted the primitive urge to swipe it on. He was master of the bridge on amarrian ship on just cause, and he would be damned if he abandon his posture before his lord and his God.</p>
<p>-<em>Rex meus et Deus rex meus Deus meus. Beata Catiz salve regina mea.</em><br>
Lord Vaari’s ship artificial intelligence started hymning in local frequencies when it was finally sure it was entering battle. Lord Vaari felt his ship’s…excitement perhaps when space were closing fast.</p>
<p>Then blinding light erupted from TES Strawberry. Mankind’s technical knowledge were turned into tool of war and destruction. Even if these lasers were small, they were still unimaginable strong, capable of vaporising metal of mixture of metals of any kind. At the same time CVA’s frigate flashed just as bright when its shield intercepted the destructive energies.</p>
<p>Just moments after the shield flash, multiple light dots were registered when hawk launched its many missiles. Hundred warhead travelled many kilometers in second towards TES Strawberry. Each missile carried terrible artifact of doom and destruction at the tip of its tube like construct. They too were intercepted by shield systems of Lord Vaari’s ship.</p>
<p>Colossal exchange of energy and missiles raged and burned in space. Ships circled around each other, computer and crew making their utmost to find best possible angle of fire, to fire maneuvering thrusters just in time or just trying to contain battle damage.</p>
<p>In command bridge of the TES Strawberry, command crew were acting nervously, but resolutely. Their Lord were there to guide them. Runes of power shined brightly on command capsule, when Lord Vaari gathered his strength to perform another feat of heroism. Radiant light shined his presence that was capsule and his crew took courage in that.</p>
<p>This was the dawn of reconquest of Providence and everyone knew it. This was to be triumphant victory. Vengeance from the many wrongs that were suffered in the hands of evil CVA’s usurper tyrant Xhjfx the Eater of Feces. This was Lord Vaari’s great moment and he felt it. He felt divine presence and knew he was at the right. He was here to punish the traitors and heretics. He was the God’s displeasure towards CVA manifested into this mortal realm.</p>
<p>TES Strawberry were fastly showing its superiority. GROUND XERO, heretical servant of the CVA were utterly and totally lacking skills to challenge the champion of Amarr, the Great Jarl of Sosan VII. What was that foolish boy thinking? That he is facing some self important nobleman? Little did he know.</p>
<p>Lord Vaari felt everything on his command capsule. He felt how missiles collapsed into amarrian shields and he saw how his lasers, which were now extension of his arms penetrated first the shield and then the pitiful armor of the caldari design ships.</p>
<p>-Strange. How can they wage war with these?<br>
Lord Vaari think of caldari design. He muted the audio systems so bridge crew could not hear him.</p>
<p>Lord Vaari felt how his ship howled in his mind. While AI were rather simple, it too felt the rush of immediate victory, but also danger that follows it. Local CVA garrisons were on the move and local signals were multiplying by the minute.</p>
<p>Lord Vaari yelled in his mind oaths of loyalty to Her Imperial Majesty, beloved by all and God Omnipotent, and his command capsules audio devices transferred thoght into audible form! Crew stomped the floor and repeated the war cries! The GROUND XERO’s ship transferred to local full of mournfull binary wail of its death when its structure finally could not take any more.</p>
<p>Energy transmitters, fuel pipes and ammuniation storages started to explode. Finally at the brightness of star it’s warp core finally ran out of power and then it was over. Violent explosion melted, shattered and tore open everything on CVA’s ship that were not already be considered a wreck. The battle was over. It was over and it was incredible victory for Amarrian loyalists. It was the mark of Aegis Militias ultimate victory closing and liberation of Providence from the tyranny of misguidance, heresy and treason.</p>
<p>-<em>Engines full. We evacuate this system. Destination, rally point alpha.</em><br>
Lord Vaari made his thoughts heard.</p>
<p>-So it happens.<br>
Master of the bridge said and nodded to helm.</p>
<p>TES Strawberry left the system just before CVA’s garrison armada jumped in. They cursed and hissed like snakes they were. Promising vengeance and most foul torture if they ever get their hands to the venerable Lord Vaari.</p>
<p>Later TES Strawberry docked into Aegis Militia’s citadel in secret location. Some of the militia were already ready to greet him and the air lock when Lord Vaari walked into station.</p>
<p>They were roaring in excitement together with the thousands of crewmen of the citadel. All his loyal friends were there celebrating the fall of the CVA and rise of the righteousness… Lord Kithrus the Unrelenting crusader. Leader of the Aegis Militia. Lord Graelyn the keeper of Faith and many more.</p>
<p>This was Lord Vaari’s day. This was victory day.</p>
