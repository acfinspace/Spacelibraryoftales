<p>Fists pounded the table. Voices rose in anger. Resolutions to remain calm were forgotten. There was too much at stake.</p>
<p>“Jarvis, we cannot, it will be the end!”</p>
<p>“Abril, we must, or we will die.”</p>
<p>“NO! You are wrong!”</p>
<p>“I am not wrong, you do not listen!”</p>
<p>“I am NOT. I am not ……… wrong.”</p>
<p>Doors slammed, and the room was empty.</p>
<p>Why the two of them returned a few minutes later, fists clenched, voices strained and breaking with rage, was a mystery neither fully understood. And yet they were there again, facing each other, each standing their ground, each staring straight and direct into flaming eyes, each demanding to be heard. And when, exactly, there was an answer, neither was sure of that, either. But it was sometime after the rage had declined from its height, from one minute of blindness to the next of light, and each had taken a small step, that the mix of rage and need gave way to agreement.</p>
<p>“We will exit the wormhole and face what is on the other side,” Abril relented.</p>
<p>“We will leave good pilots and researchers here to find out why these wormholes are growing,” Jarvis agreed.</p>
<p>And so it was that they stayed the course another day. Another day, since the wormholes had started increasing in size 6 months ago, initially causing little concern. More belts, more rats, more anomalies, more scannable exits, more room for more pilots to make more ISK. Nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>But then, gradually, it had become evident that there was some percentage of space that was being lost outside the wormholes, lost as the holes themselves grew, shrinking the space most lived in. Small amounts at first, but accelerating in pace, and swiftly leading to the recognition that this could not be a good thing in the long run.</p>
<p>Not a good thing at all.</p>
<p>———————————–</p>
<p>Jarvis and Abril had met some time ago at a stupid event, some tournament played by over-serious sports enthusiasts and watched by unenthusiastic fans only hoping for their own glory in the public analysis afterwards. Both had paused while traveling by the event to throw a few insulting comments onto the tournament comments board, intending to continue on their way shortly. Instead they found themselves on opposing sides of a mostly meaningless argument, but each unable to leave the last word to the other.</p>
<p>“That Jaybird pilot needs to get in closer with a tighter orbit. He is too easy to lock out there. When did he start flying, two days ago?”, commented Abril.</p>
<p>“Not so, sweetheart, take into account the ship. It’s a new Emeritus with the huge target-blocking bonus. He’s fine. It’s the other guy that needs to stop trying to shoot it and get his buddies to help him.”</p>
<p>“Don’t sweetheart me, whoever you are, you retard.”</p>
<p>“Don’t retard me, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>And so it went downhill from there, the language escalating past what either would want recorded. Those in the tournament did not notice the exchange. Jarvis and Abril met at a nearby fortizar for coffee.</p>
<p>The meeting was as disastrous as the earlier exchange, made all the worse when they met and saw that Jarvis wore the dark blue crest of the Spirit Priesthood, Abril the orange of the Order of Synergies, two vigilantly opposing priest groups.  What resulted held no grace, it was simply a brawl between them over flasks of dark, hyper-caffeinated juices. In the end, they could not even agree to disagree, instead each simply recognizing that the brawl was far from over. Though neither was quite sure what exactly they had been arguing about, it was something related to the First War of Determination several years back and which side had the more justifiable cause. Nevertheless, they vowed never to bother completing the discussion as it was certainly pointless. Somebody said something along the lines of “well, THAT was a waste of time,” to which the other only commented “as if your time was particularly valuable.”</p>
<p>Returning to the fortizar after that to drink more reliably interesting drinks together, arguments and irreconcilable religious differences continued from there. Abril could never give up the cornerstone faith of the Order of Synergies, a demanding and sober requirement that followers worship, revere, and obey the Words of Reconciliation.  Jarvis was a steadfast and orthodox Spirit Priest, never veering from his commitment to the Words of Assertion.  And both were inclined to too frequently quote from their respective religious works, simply causing another round of drinks along with a louder round of escalation for whatever argument was at hand.</p>
<p>At some point, setting aside their flasks of often-refilled alcoholic beverages, they carried their differences to the field. And now they found themselves still arguing incessantly while successfully conquering systems together, a surprise to both of them.  Their followers wondered how they had time for it, between the screaming arguments, but conquer they did and soon jointly held two and a half regions. Some combination of opposing opinions seemed to have come together for a winning formula, which neither of them took the time – or had the inclination — to either notice or analyze.</p>
<p>The Second War of Determination was a particularly bloody one. Jarvis and Abril were on the same side, needing to protect their joint holdings, but inevitably found themselves quoting from their respective scriptures too often and too loudly, as always.</p>
<p>“Back down only when forced,” quoted Jarvis as they circled a crucial strategic gate at the entrance leading to their main staging system.</p>
<p>“Know your allies and respect them,” quoted Abril in return.</p>
<p>“They are neut, shoot them”, returned Jarvis.</p>
<p>“They are blue, talk to them”, replied Abril.</p>
<p>And so it went, both checking standings sheets and realizing that there was an error somewhere, and no time to straighten it out.</p>
<p>In the end, Jarvis ordered a tackle and primaried their FC. The fleet fled, shouting threats of an AWOX arrest. No arrest was forthcoming, and it was found out subsequently that the standings error had been a deliberate one on the part of a spy.  Jarvis was right. Abril conceded that he was right, quoting her own scriptures, “admit your fault when you are wrong”, a quote that was duplicated in Jarvis’ Words of Assertion, though neither ever openly admitted that commonality of belief.</p>
<p>Later in the war, they found themselves in a raging argument about how best to handle a two-front assault on their territory.  Jarvis thought it best to divide their fleets between the two areas, splitting their own forces and those of their allies between the two. Abril wanted to let their allies handle one front while their own fleets took the other.</p>
<p>“Rely on your own initiative and you will not be disappointed,” quoted Jarvis, “Let’s be sure we have a presence in both places so we are sure we are not betrayed.</p>
<p>“Know your allies and trust them,” retorted Abril.  “Your way and we will be split in both places, with split doctrines, and will have a harder time coordinating across alliances. We can trust our allies.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure of that.”</p>
<p>“I am”</p>
<p>In the end, Jarvis reluctantly agreed to Abril’s plan – and admitted to its correctness when the battle was handily won.</p>
<p>The Second War of Determination was a long one, tempers sharpened and voices harshened over months of weary battle. At the win, there was a celebration of course, with much singing, joking and banter. Abril and Jarvis stayed carefully on opposite sides of the room, both secretly wondering just how much more of the arguing they were really interested in, now that their territory was secured.  Whether this meant thoughts of parting or reconciliation, neither has ever admitted.</p>
<p>Regardless, there was not, at the moment, a chance of a discussion of either option, because shortly after the war ended, the Problem of the Wormholes became both evident and urgent. Systems were shrinking – then disappearing — at the edges of outlying regions. Territory wars were fought everywhere as panic increased at the anticipation of increasingly reduced space. Some moved into the growing wormholes, bringing their allies with them when they could. Wars inside the wormholes then increased, too, as people realized that more and more would be coming in from shrinking areas even as the wormholes grew in size.  Adding to the problem was that the larger wormholes also had larger entrances now – much higher masses could pass through them before they closed, meaning much bigger surprises both coming into and out of wormholes – and larger, bloodier wars along with that.</p>
<p>The debate between Abril and Jarvis was a basic one.  Do we go into a wormhole to fight?  Or stay here and fight? And this time it was not an argument over flasks of coffee and scripture quotes. This time it was a matter of simple, urgent, awful, real, irreversible Survival.</p>
<p>—————————</p>
<p>After a particularly messy warp drive-throwing incident and a week-long separation filled with detailed excuses and sweetheart-ridden insults, Abril and Jarvis finally chose to establish their defense  inside a wormhole, carefully selecting a small one (at least for now) with few entrances.  They brought with them a good sized contingent of their best pilots and science researchers. Their plan was to find out why the wormholes were expanding in size, presumably finding a path, then, to reducing the shrinking of the outside space. It had seemed a reasonably good idea until they realized that too much time had gone by with no clue to be found to the mystery.  Now it was time to make some decisions – stay and continue to look for the answer?  Move outside, face, and fight those trying to get in?  Find a corner of wormhole space and defend from within? Find and defend a corner of outside space in hopes that the expansion would stop at some point?</p>
<p>This was the point in the discussion where they decided – through their tried and true method of screaming, pounding, quoting, demanding, and finally stepping forward into an answer – to split forces.  Continue to look for the cause that could stop this horror, while also facing the forces threatening them from the outside.</p>
<p>Jarvis would be the one to take the force out of the wormhole and set up defenses where he could. A few systems away from the wormhole entrance would be best – camp and secure it, keep the wormhole from being over-run while those without homes were hopefully drawn to more easily accessible places to live. It would be grueling, as they would have to med clone back into the hole each time an entrance closed, scan the next one, and then exit to defend that one.  And this meant leaving expensive ships behind each time. Fortunately, they had funds and ships stockpiled – but both would run out at some point. Hopefully, some better solution could be found before then.</p>
<p>Abril would continue to defend the citadels where the research was taking place, forestalling panic where possible, defending where required. And hoping that someone somewhere, here or in another wormhole perhaps, might discover the cause of this and stop it.</p>
<p>Jarvis selected the best pilots they had, Abril arguing, of course, over the selections but ultimately giving in to the requirement that they must defend their space or the research efforts would be useless.  After a few days of drills, Jarvis took his fleet to the wormhole entrance, jumped, and was met with horror.</p>
<p>His fleet had seemed large, skilled, and a significant force when on the other side of the entrance.  On this side, the massive opposing force was overwhelming – and still forming. It was clear that the plan was to come in in force, kill, and take over the wormhole from the current inhabitants.  And the sheer size of the forming fleet ensured that this would happen as planned.</p>
<p>Jarvis had no choice but to return with whatever ships he could into the wormhole, hoping to close it with the mass he had with him in his fleet.  It didn’t work. His force was bubbled, killed, and podded before he could shout the second order.  This left an enemy fleet outside their door, with a large enough entrance to allow an overwhelming force to come into the wormhole at their pleasure. Landing back in their clones at the wormhole citadel, Jarvis met Abril with the news. They would need a new plan.</p>
<p>As they sat silently staring at each other, both realized that they would have vastly preferred a shouting match. It would at least have been a shouting match of ideas. But now they had no ideas to shout about. Just a hopelessly small holding in a wormhole about to be overrun with enemies.</p>
<p>“OK, first of all, this whole thing is completely ridiculous.” Abril spoke first. “There is still as much  space altogether as before – it’s just more wormhole space, less other space. Why all this fighting?”</p>
<p>“Because people are stupid, that’s why. They act based on fear, that’s why. They panic and do stupid things, that’s why.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, still ……. There’s more space than people right? There is space somewhere for us, right? There has to be.  Somewhere. Unless suddenly there are more people in the world – there’s no less space than before.”</p>
<p>“You are trying to be logical. People aren’t logical. They panic and take more space than they need. So there is less space available because of that.”</p>
<p>“If they take more space than they need, then, aren’t they taking more space than they can defend?”</p>
<p>“Of course, sweetheart. That is the point. And, yes, we have the forces to fight for and take poorly defended space. Problem is finding it. Other problem is keeping it against all of the other folks who have the same idea.”</p>
<p>“You are so ……..  SO …….. infuriating!   Not willing to even consider DOING something?  You are just SITTING here drinking your coffee, too lazy, now, to pick up your feet and get into a ship.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well YOU are the one who got us in here, refused to let me hold the space we had, insisted that the wormhole was the only place to go.  And so, yes, you forced my hand. Now we’re here. And here we are.”  He took another sip.  “And how do you like being here, NOW?”</p>
<p>“OK”  Abril took a slow breath.  “You ………. Were ………. Right.   You were right, you were right, you were right, you were right.  NOW can we go out and find us some space to live in?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sweetheart, now we can. Thank you for your apology.”</p>
<p>Abril’s retort was simply a long hard look, and the sound of “retard” perhaps heard quietly.</p>
<p>The next morning, Abril and Jarvis and their group of strong and skilled pilots gathered freighters and ships, loaded with all they had, scanned and scouted an exit, and left their citadel behind for others to pillage.</p>
<p>Outside they found chaos.</p>
<p>Navigating carefully at first, then desperately and sometimes recklessly, the contingent began their journey in search of space grabbed too quickly and defended too lightly. Better organized than most, they were able to keep most of their assets and ships. Scouts reported that non-wormhole space was densely occupied and heavily armed. Wormhole space was defended with equal paranoia and rarely accessible. Perhaps their problem had been decisions too slowly made and too quickly changed – as both asserted at one point or another depending on who was most furious at the time – or maybe simply bad luck. In either case, there was not much to do now aside from continuing to move and keep watch.</p>
<p>As the days and months flowed, weariness and fear left Jarvis and Abril without the strength to throw any more warp drives, but never too tired for the swords and spears of heated words and the insistence on driving a point in to its hilt.</p>
<p>“If we had stayed in our original territory, we would not be in this mess.”</p>
<p>“No, we would be over-run by now.”</p>
<p>“You underestimate our troops and skill.”</p>
<p>“You over-estimate what can be done against desperate and overwhelming opposition.”</p>
<p>After many rounds of this argument, leaving their troops whispering plans to leave to try something new, a decision was made.</p>
<p>“Enough of this, let us solve it by finding out. We’ll go back to our original territory.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go back then, yes. You will see.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will.”</p>
<p>“Yes you will.”</p>
<p>Which solved the problem of the almost-mutinying troops, who now had a new interest, a new goal, and a new unanswered controversy on which to place their wagers.</p>
<p>And so, scouts were sent ahead and the trip began. Hostilities were generally handled with strategic cloaking, kiting, superior discipline, and quick and decisive action.   There were battles that left all breathless and shouting at their own ships, “no, no, hurry, hurry, come oooooooooon warp drive” – where generally all made it out but a few large and lumbering maledictions flown by swearing pilots.  And then there was that lost freighter group, caught on a gate and given up to the larger hostile fleet while as many as could, escaped and congregated at a nearby station for the consolation of cards and drink. But all in all, the loses were surprisingly small compared to the chaos around them, and cool heads eventually brought them two systems from the edge of their former jointly-held territory … where they looked ahead and saw emptiness. Their space had disappeared and now no chance to prove either of them right or wrong in the months-long argument that had managed to be revived at most stops along the way.</p>
<p>Through the next months of wondering, more freighters began to be lost, wallet dwindled, and hope dwindled more. Chaos can only be navigated, not argued with or quelled through reason. Survival was the only goal, and now even winning an argument a colorless victory. Jump – cloak – watch – report – warp and jump again. Days were nothing of interest any more, talk pointless, survival mindless. Keep moving, that was all that mattered, now. Keep moving.  Until ………. When?</p>
<p>The day the wormholes stopped growing and territories and space stabilized was as mysterious as the day it had begun. Perhaps it was the gods of the Spirit Priesthood, asserting the Words of Assertion and their control over all of Eve, the whimsey of power used as it pleased, the laughter of the gods giving grace finally to the world they ruled. Or, maybe it was the gods of the Order of Synergies, bringing the Words of Reconciliation finally to the front of the line, the balance of space restored, and the happiness of Eve’s people made possible again. Jarvis and Abril never resolved this question, though it was of course debated thoroughly.</p>
<p>“Assertion over the wormholes, how else could the balance be restored. They were out of control, only force would bring them back to right behavior. My gods were able to do this, they are mighty, and prevail always. Insist and it will be done. There is no other answer.”</p>
<p>“Reconciliation between two opposing forces brings them to right balance.  Both are still here, both gave up something for the peace both needed. My gods did not give up until agreement was reached, an answer found, and rightness restored. Act in haste to your destruction, listen and you will prevail. There is no other answer.”</p>
<p>“Listening never won anything.”</p>
<p>“Might alone never solved anything for long.”</p>
<p>“The strength of my gods brought you a new and stable home. You can’t argue with that.”</p>
<p>“I can and I will. My gods brought you a stable and peaceful world again. There is nothing more to say.”</p>
<p>“Yes there is and I will say it.”</p>
<p>“No, there is not, that is the end of it.”</p>
<p>“It is the end of it because I have won my point.”</p>
<p>“NO, you have not ……. “</p>
<p>And so the argument continued into the years of growth and prosperity that followed, taking many forms along the way. There were various creative methods of making a point (a particularly interesting round of might verses trust involved volunteers and some sort of retracting sword), discussions late into the night, a few personal duals, and the still-studied Noob Ship Challenge.  But by far the best and still remembered debate was the 4-hour shouting match on the familiar topic of Spirit vrs Synergy gods that took place at the 20-year anniversary of the ending of the Problem of Wormholes.  Amid a quickly mounting bidding war wager on the ultimate winner, the arguing continued as bidding rose and finally passed the 500 trillion mark, a height never matched before or since, and which was eventually divided equally when no victor could be established.</p>
