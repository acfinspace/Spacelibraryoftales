> Entry for the YC119 New Eden Capsuleer Writing Contest for the Poetry category.

I see myself, the man of flesh
I see the capsuleer

I see my hands
I see drone-like metal extensions

I feel my skin
I feel the coldness of a metal shell

I feel the chill air in my lungs
I feel the burning feeling of decompression

I see the darkness, my eyes closed

I see crystal-clean water
I see the blood of the people I killed forever

I see myself
I see the capsuleer

I see the murderer

I see the immortal

I see the mortal inside
