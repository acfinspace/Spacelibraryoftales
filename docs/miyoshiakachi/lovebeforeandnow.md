# Love, before and now

> Entry for the Amore Tank Your Hearts Contest.


Shining stars on the inky backdrop of the night sky.
   She loved staring at them, they looked like they were blinking.
   She wondered how amazing secrets they held.
   She dreamed to be with them one day.

Trees blossoming in the soft spring breeze.
   She was sitting below them, readying, studying.
   It all felt peaceful.
   She loved relaxing there.

Flying at break-neck speed.
   The wind caressing hard her face.
   Her hand tight on the handles as she flew fast and nimble.
   She loved flying with her speeder bike.
   It was dangerous, yet so exciting.

She felt the head of her love resting on her shoulder, her warm body resting softly against hers. All she was dreaming were things of the past. She still loved them but now, love had a wider, bigger meaning. She had a person to love with all her heart.

Her love.
   She couldn't describe how much it meant to her.
   She loved every thing of her.
   She couldn't resist her touch.
   She couldn't resist her voice.
   Her laugh was a beautiful sound.
   Her smile brightened every room.
   Without her love, the world wasnâ€™t the same.

She smiled, her head leaning and resting against her lover's one. Nose against nose, their breath mixing. Their lips just a breathe away.

She had opened her to a new way of living, of fighting, of loving. She had changed everything. She had turned her world upside down and upright again. She had brought blinding light and burning passion. She had brought her in a new heaven.

Their lips brushed and without ever thinking they kissed. They would never ever get enough of such a small gesture still full of such deep meanings. It always made them feel better, stronger, happier.

She loved her.

She will ever do.
