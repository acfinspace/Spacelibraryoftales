# Welcome to the Space library of tales

*The Space library of tales, a repository of EvE Online fan fiction.*

The idea: to build a lasting repository of fan fiction, both prose and poetry, set in the world of EvE Online. Forums come and go and what it had been written there disappears as their hosts are gone.

The Space library of tales wants to avoid that as per the following points:

1. It is hosted on GitHub through the GitHub pages meaning it is hosted on a free and public repository, on a service that won't, hopefully, die without notice.
2. Being public means people can contribute and help the project grow.
3. It runs on open source technologies (Mkdocs, Material for Mkdocs) used in other fields as well.
4. In the case I don't want to maintain the repository anymore, the repository can be transfered/copied to another user that can continue what I started.
5. It is all written in markdown, as easy and lightweight as it can get. Storing a lot of fiction shouldn't be too much of a problem.

### The library's structure
Authors and contests have a dedicated page, visible on the left, where you can find all the related content. At the moment we have:

- Authors: 2
- Contests: 0

### How to contribute

If you want to contribute, you can:

- Add a page yourself through a pull request. Let's try to have the same format all around.
    - One page per written piece, named with the piece title all together and in small characters (es.: The Interview becomes theinterview.md)
    - The pieces are to be put into a folder with the author's name all together and in small characters (es.: Miyoshi Akachi becomes miyoshiakachi).
    - Otherwise, each piece can be named as author_title and be put in the "miscauthors" folder (es.: miyoshiakachi_theinterview).
- Shoot me a message on Discord, at miyoshiakachi.

If you want your art to be removed, you can:

- Shoot me a message on Discord, at miyoshiakachi with some proof that it's your art.
- Make a pull request removing the pages with your art with some proof that it's your art.
