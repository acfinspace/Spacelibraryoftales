# Welcome to the Space library of tales

*The Space library of tales, a repository of EvE Online fan fiction.*

The idea: to build a lasting repository of fan fiction written inside the world of EvE Online. Forums come and go and what it had been written there disappears as their hosts are gone, being relegated to the Time Machine (if it gets there).

The Space library of tales wants to avoid that as per the following points:

1. It is hosted on Github through GitHub pages.
2. It is hosted through a public repository, thus people can contribute and help the project grow.
3. It runs on open source technologies (Mkdocs, Material for Mkdocs) used in other fields as well.
4. In the case I don't want to maintain the repository anymore, the repo can be transfered/copied.
5. It is all written in markdown, as easy as it can get.

### The library's structure
Authors and contests will have a dedicated page from which to reach the fiction itself.
A stands for Author
C stands for Contest


### The project going forward
To do:
 - [ ] Tweak and finalize the library itself
 - [ ] Night mode/light mode
 - [ ] Keep on adding more fiction
 - [ ] Add contests like the Pod & Planet
