# Welcome to the Space library of tales

The idea is to build a lasting repository of fiction written inside the world of EvE Online. Forums come and go and what it had been written there disappears ass their hosts are gone.

The Space library of tales wants to avoid that by:

1. It is hosted on Github through GitHub pages
2. It is hosted through a public repository, thus people can contribute and help the project grow
3. It runs on open source technologies (Mkdocs, Kkdocs for Material) used in other fields as well
4. In the case I don't want to maintain anymore the repo, the repo can be transfered/copied

### The library's structure
Prolific authors and contests will have a dedicated page from which to reach the fiction itself.
    * A stands for Author
    * C stands for Contest


### The project going forward
Second half of 2023:
    - [ ] Keep on adding more fiction
    - [ ] Tweak and finalize the library itself
    - [ ] Get some collaborators hopefully.
    - [ ] Night mode/light mode
