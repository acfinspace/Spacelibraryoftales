# Welcome to the Space library of tales

*The Space library of tales, a repository of EvE Online fan fiction.*

The idea: to build a lasting repository of fan fiction, both prose and poetry, set in the world of EvE Online. Forums come and go and what it had been written there disappears as their hosts are gone.

The Space library of tales wants to avoid that as per the following points:

1. It is hosted on GitHub through the GitHub pages meaning it is hosted on a free and public repository, on a service that won't, hopefully, die without notice.
2. Being public means people can contribute and help the project grow.
3. It runs on open source technologies (Mkdocs, Material for Mkdocs) used in other fields as well.
4. In the case I don't want to maintain the repository anymore, the repository can be transfered/copied to another user that can continue what I started.
5. It is all written in markdown, as easy and lightweight as it can get. Storing a lot of fiction shouldn't be too much of a problem.

### The library's structure

To navigate the library either start from the Authors' index gathering all the authors in the library or from the Contest index gathering all contest which submissions are in the library.

- Authors: see [Authors index](authorsindex.md)
- Contests: see [Contest index](contestindex.md)

Each author with more than one piece hosted in the library have dedicated pages listing their works. Author's pages can be customized at request, write me a message on Discord, at miyoshiakachi or make a pull request adding it, kind of like new fiction.


### How to contribute

If you want to contribute, you can:

- Add a page yourself through a pull request. Let's try to have the same format all around.
    - One page per written piece, named with the piece title all together and in small characters (es.: The Interview becomes theinterview.md)
    - If the author has 2 or more pieces, the pieces are to be put into a folder with the author's name all together and in small characters (es.: Miyoshi Akachi becomes miyoshiakachi).
    - Otherwise, each piece can be named as author_title and be put in the "miscauthors" folder (es.: miyoshiakachi_theinterview).
- Shoot me a message on Discord, at miyoshiakachi and let's talk.

If you want your art to be removed, you can:

- Shoot me a message on Discord, at miyoshiakachi, with some proof that it's your art.
- Open an issue on GitHub asking for the removal of the pages with the art and with some proof that it's your art.
