> Author's note: This is my entry into the poetry category for the Capsuleer Writing Contest. I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of the pre-contact Achur culture, which I’ve written about in previous contests [and which is the subject of a long-form novel I’ve been working on for three years now, being published in chapters over on Backstage]. These poems may be considered singly or as a whole. Hope you enjoy them!

*Poems of the Sky Temple of the Northern Seas, from the Long Winter Period*

> Author's Note: the following poems and literary fragments were recovered from the ruins of the Sky Temple of the Northern Seas, unearthed in archaeological expeditions undertaken during the post-contact assimilation of the Achura homeworld into the Caldari State. Recent scholarly research suggests that this Temple persisted as an isolated settlement for several centuries during the Long Winter Period, maintaining a monastery and subsisting in the harsh northern climate long after most other outposts had been abandoned. By the later Long Spring Period the Temple was no longer inhabited, but many of its manuscripts were preserved by the cold temperatures and salinization from sea air. They are notable for the relatively unchanged literary forms employed, as the isolated Temple monks and nuns copied and re-copied the same limited set of texts over several centuries, rigidly repeating the styles of the broader Achur culture to which they no longer had access. The versions here mostly conform to the Sky Temple’s characteristic “tandem style” of speaking and writing, in which two authors share a single voice, and which this presentation attempts to preserve. The title of the collection is from the Caldari-language translation published in the Proceedings of the Archaeological Institute of the School of Applied Knowledge in YC27.

### 1. Black Leopard

Spring sun *shining* , faint rose *low*
*in the sky* , shining, *shining*
on the ice *and glinting*, glinting
on the sea.
The great waves surge *back and forth*
thunder *of all the world* crashing
on the rocks, *crashing*
the mountains, *unmoved* , cold and still.
In the swells *of the sea* , beneath the waves
*black leopards stalk* , back and forth
searching, *seeking*
silent and powerful, *and I am afraid* .
*In our hut* , warm with fire
we celebrated First Spring Moon
*with a feast* , and dancing, spinning *back and forth*
you were laughing , warm with fire and wine.
I didn’t see the black leopard
*silent and powerful* , its spirit slipped from the waves
stalking, back and forth, *beyond the village*
*searching *.

Now I watch the spring sun *rising*
and the waves surging *back and forth*
the black leopard *is returned to its body* , warm with feast
*and I don’t want to turn back to my hut* , cold and still
*unmoving* .

### 2. Temple Song

*Raise your voices* to the Sea Wind
*through the roof* , to the open sky.
Raise your eyes *to the vault of the heavens*
the home of the winds
*mother of the seas*
temple *of all temples* , in the open sky.
Lift *your feet* from the ground
*trace spirals in the water* , dancing
the dance *of the heavens*
turning *like clouds* in the open sky.
Let *the wind and the waters*
*flow through you* , carry you
like ice *on a river*
*spinning* and roiling
*back and forth* , through open sky.
Give your soul *to the Gods*
*carried* on the winds
*across the ocean* , across the heavens
to the temple beyond *the open sky* .

### 3. Shadow Play

*Watching shadows* dance on stone walls
telling the story *of the Gods of Storms*
the mighty Hunter *strikes a bold figure*
rippling *in the winds* of the great weather
*unafraid* and valiant.
The drummers play *a martial rhythm*
the Hunter chases *the Thief*
his limbs so fast! *Outpacing his shadow*
across the stones.

*Oh* ! my legs are too heavy,
I run, the ice cracks
thunder *drumming* the mountains
but I cannot catch my prey.
*Oh* ! my legs are too slow
I sing *a martial* song
*and the storm* carries me
across the plain.

The storm *flashes* , shadows *on shadows*
*rippling* across the sky,
I think of *her* who carries *my heart*
back home *in the village* .
Oh! if I would bring her *something*
*fat and heavy* , a feast to celebrate
dancing, our shadows *rippling* together
*on stone walls*
warm *and unafraid* .

### 4. Lullaby

Sleep! *Sleep* , my darling
*the sun is set* , below the mist
the sea is calm, *rocking you* ,
piece *of my heart* .
If your soul *should fly* away
with the winds
let the Gods of Sky
*hear my song* and bring you back
*to me*
and let no dream *disturb you* .

*Sleep* ! Sleep, my little one
the hearth *is warm* ,
I am here *by your side*
*to sing you* this song
so the Gods of Sky
*bring you back*
to me.

Sleep! *Sleep* , my quiet one
*the morning* will soon be here
the sun will fill your cheeks
*with rose once more*
the wind will fill your mouth
*with laughter once more*
The Gods of Sky
will bring your soul back
*to me* .

*Sleep* ! Sleep, my beloved
rocking* in my arms*
a little longer.
*The morning is here*
The Gods of Sky shake off
*the veil of night*
the mists are close
and the morning *is chilled*
but here in my arms
you’re *still warm*
with me.

### 5. Prayer for Morning

O Gods *of Wind* !
Make me *your servant*
and guide *my hand* .
*Fill me* with your might
*and show me* the hidden path
through *the mountains* .
*O Gods* of Wind!
*Fill me* with your grace
and look favorably *upon me* .
May our feet *be swift* and sure
may the storm spare us *its wrath*
*our hands strong* and clever
our eyes *sharp and wise* .
O Gods *of Wind* !
*Take pity* on me!
The night *was long* and cold
and the sun *has not* yet warmed
this world, o *bitter fate* !
My bones ache
but by your mercy
*I stride out* into the mist
in your sheltering hand
*I am not afraid .*

O Gods of the Heavens!
Hear my prayer
which I send to the sky
with the cold morning sun
that you might hear it
and take pity on me
your servant
and return to me once more
to fill me with your grace
and show me the path of rightness
once more.

### 6. Prayer for Evening

O Gods *of Stars* ,
Gods *of the Sea Wind* ,
still your anger
*the sun is set .*
Let the hearth stay warm
*'til morning*
Let the snows fall gently
*in the night*
Let the lantern-oil burn clean
*and cheerful*
keeping the night at bay
*'til morning .*

We are small and fearful
*before you*
We plead for mercy
*before you*
For nothing in this world endures
*before you*
Accept this prayer and offering
*before you*
And keep warm the hearth
of those who bow down
*before you .*

Let me lay myself *down*
*on the cold ground*
before you
*for the sun is set*
and the lanterns have gone out
*on this world*
I pray for you to take my soul
and pity me
*your servant*
When I give my breath to you<br>
*'til morning.*
