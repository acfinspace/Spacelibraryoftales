# Nine Lyrics of Hirvomiakken

> Author: Elassus Herron

> Author's Note: This is my entry into the poetry category for the Capsuleer Writing Contest. I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of the pre-contact Achur culture, which I’ve written about in previous contests [and which is the subject of a long-form novel I’ve been working on since last year, being published in chapters over on Backstage]. These poems may be considered singly or as a whole. Hope you enjoy them!

**Ochuvakuekkujo, Halavainu Bazeiku**<br>
**Atop Monument Hill, Spirals of Frost are Blooming into Splendor**

> Note: “Hirvomiakken” was the pen-name of Kujaromakka Soichiru, eldest daughter of a foreign minister to the Western Islands during the Achur Long-Spring Era, corresponding to approximately 1,500 years pre-contact. Little else is known about her but that she was lauded as a gifted poet, and served as a capable diplomat in her own right later in life. These poems capture a time in Achur history marked by relative peace and cultural advancement, when cultivation of the more refined arts among the aristocratic and courtier classes was considered not only a personal virtue, but a necessary reassurance of growing prosperity. They are nevertheless noteworthy for the complex mix of imagery and moods, capturing something of a lingering unease amidst cultural revival. These lyrics are selected from a few sources scattered in archives, mostly in monasteries, suggesting that Hirvomiakken’s poems were widely read and highly valued. The title is taken from the Napanii-language translation of the most well-known of the collection, from the scholarly edition published in YC36.

### 1.

Autumn Festival<br>
the lanterns along the riverside<br>
standing witness<br>
to the passage of the longboat<br>
its tiller rustling in the waters<br>
of the midnight river,<br>
casting echos of its passage<br>
to the shores of every night thereafter.

The pilgrim sits at the bow<br>
and recites his prayers by heart.<br>
The veil of the night draws down,<br>
and the valley is hung with mist,<br>
and the lights of the distant village<br>
wink out,<br>
one<br>
after<br>
the other.<br>
The pilgrim glimpses in the night<br>
the first of the leaves<br>
drifting loose from their branches<br>
drifting down,<br>
to settle<br>
in the midnight river<br>
drifting beside him.<br>
The lanterns along the riverside<br>
count off the longboat’s passing<br>
as all the rest of the world<br>
settles down to sleep.

### 2.

On the bridge of the city of Tan<br>
the strains of a lyre<br>
playing folk-tunes from the country<br>
in the classical style.<br>
The trees hang over the riverbanks<br>
and young lovers sit beneath them.<br>
I watch the fish swim back and forth<br>
beneath the water<br>
and hear laughter from the tea-houses<br>
and wonder:<br>
how long must I yet wait, my love,<br>
before we are together once more?<br>

### 3.

A young woman,<br>
startled by the well,<br>
drawing water.<br>
The young man,<br>
dressed in five-colored robes,<br>
the glass-fish and golden lyre-bird<br>
dancing across his shoulders,<br>
flashing in the sun.<br>
“Sir, where are you going,<br>
dressed in festival robes?”<br>
The young man smiles, gestures with his walking stick<br>
to the distant mountains.<br>
“There, in the Temple of Skies,<br>
I am to meet His Majesty to celebrate midsummer.”<br>
The young woman gazes to the mountains, distant and hazy.<br>
“Sir,” she whispers,<br>
“the Temple of Skies is far. The spring tea-leaves are ready,<br>
there in my house.”<br>
Pointing to the shade behind.

### 4.

Under the pagoda of the summer palace<br>
drinking wine beside the lake,<br>
the sun hangs still in the sky, pale rose.<br>
Over the distant mountains clouds are rushing,<br>
you laugh<br>
and at the sound of it<br>
a flock of gray fisher-birds takes flight.

### 5.

The streets of the great Temple Market<br>
are hung with lanterns<br>
and the musicians are all singing<br>
a theater troupe is singing opera<br>
about a long-forgotten princess and her knight.<br>
The market-goers clap and throw coins<br>
and the crowd fades away.

### 6.

Spring rains<br>
on the hilltop garden<br>
some of the stones have been swept and laid with flowers.<br>
The wreaths from Spring Festival are still fresh.<br>
Some of the stones have toppled, and lie in the shadows,<br>
overgrown and dusted with the last snowfall.<br>
The sun sets<br>
through the falling rains.

### 7.

In the Western District of Tan-Isu<br>
all the rooves are red and green and brown and gold<br>
in the predawn light.<br>
The ornaments glitter on the corners of the Temple’s<br>
thatch roof.<br>
Atop Monument Hill<br>
spirals of frost are blooming into splendor<br>
as I tread a winding path<br>
and read the markers of ancient nobles<br>
their names wreathed around me<br>
in the lingering chill.

A young soldier<br>
beloved of the princess<br>
pledged his valor<br>
in her service.<br>
Her name has faded<br>
from his monument stone.<br>
Late spring snow<br>
drifts slowly down<br>
over the threshold<br>
of the hilltop shrine<br>
landing at the foot of the altar;<br>
and outside, slowly burying the markers<br>
as the pale morning sun<br>
faint and wan<br>
slowly rises<br>
over the city.<br>
The soldier<br>
long past<br>
was younger than I;<br>
does any yet live who remembers<br>
the name of his beloved?

The stream thaws,<br>
the last of winter fades<br>
the Great Eyes overhead<br>
have watched over<br>
impassive<br>
eleven times eleven times eleven<br>
turns of the wheel<br>
coming back to the start.<br>
The noble dead lie in repose<br>
silent<br>
bearing witness.

Who would pledge his valor in my name?<br>
Who would attend to my monument-stone,<br>
and speak my name,<br>
sweep the path clear to leave an offering<br>
of ironwood and winter lilies,<br>
and burn the incense of the islands of Shuven<br>
to remind me of the home of my childhood?<br>
The venerable dead strode through the long winter<br>
and committed acts of heroism;<br>
the warrior-scholars<br>
who lived without fault<br>
and sung of the spring-to-come.<br>
The flower of youth<br>
that blooms in the depths of winter<br>
in the alpine hollows<br>
to stand vigil over the long night<br>
is most precious of all.

The flowers of springtime<br>
of ten thousand different hues<br>
are starting to bloom.<br>
A splendor burst forth into a world<br>
made fertile once more.<br>
The last of the snows has fallen,<br>
and the sound of temple bells<br>
ripples across the valley,<br>
across the mountains,<br>
waves rippling out across waters<br>
recently thawed<br>
with me in their wake<br>
to land on distant shores<br>
long after the bells<br>
have crumbled to dust.

### 8.

In the City of Aikoshi<br>
temple bells<br>
in the towers<br>
mark the times of prayer.

The fish swim back and forth in the pond<br>
observing the rituals<br>
saying their prayers.

### 9.

A noble woman serves tea<br>
at the Lyuusha Golden Crane House<br>
on the way to the Winter Palace.<br>
The Veil blots out the stars<br>
in the south.<br>
In the village temple, a solitary flute<br>
plays mournfully.
