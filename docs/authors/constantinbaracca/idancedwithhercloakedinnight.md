I knew her when I still was young, for my fam’ly knew her well,<br>
And all and sundry spoke of her,<br>
With rev’rent awe, yet they prefer,<br>
To leave her dance alone, so turns,<br>
She ‘neath the stars, swirling round the gown of night she wore,<br>
And surely I was far too young; she’s for men who came before,<br>
But that night came I came a man,<br>
And smiling coaxed me ‘cross that span,<br>
Of ages, seized me by my hands,<br>
And from the challenge courtsied, let the music ‘twixt us knell.

“I knew you when I still was young and I oft wondered when we’d meet,<br>
I said, “You’re fairer than they say,<br>
When they recall the fateful day,<br>
They first beheld you ‘neath the rays,<br>
Of light that lit the charming whit of wile within your smile.”<br>
We turned a natural turn though she spoke solemnly a while,<br>
For men who’d wooed her ne’er recall,<br>
By faith and bravery withal,<br>
She’d answer at their every call,<br>
To hold them dear and dance until the daylight they could greet.

She’d tell me tales when I was young that heave my heart with horror now,<br>
And with a pivot step she told,<br>
Of men and women she’d enfold,<br>
And in the silent notes behold,<br>
Them laid to sleep beside her in the meadows ‘neath the stars,<br>
But for one sleepless night deigned she to grace them in their arms,<br>
“Forsooth, is all your perfect beauty,<br>
Thus to mask some callous cruelty,<br>
That you as some bitter duty,<br>
Vow eternity in loving bliss, a kiss as winds ephemeral?”

And though I’d heard when I was young her heart was as some callous stone,<br>
Closely held, she spoke through tears,<br>
Of time where hours turned to years,<br>
Of her great Lord the good revere,<br>
Of gallants, lemans both she’d kept and lost to His decree,<br>
She’d cherished every one, and pled for each eternally.<br>
But she could not with wealth afford,<br>
To keep one lover from her Lord,<br>
For unto untold gold reward,<br>
They left her at the sunrise, let her wake in dark alone.

Oh, I’d been warned when I was young, seek not that stunning silver gaze,<br>
But by those whispers on her lips,<br>
And hands allowed around her hips,<br>
To gentle, supple steps and slips,<br>
Become enthralled, for moonlight lit her eyes and welling tears,<br>
She mourned my coming leaving even as she held me near,<br>
Her touch, as fire, made me brave,<br>
And strong and safe, ‘ere came that day,<br>
Our dance would find that last chassé,<br>
Among her dew-dropped grasses shrouded in her polonaise.

But I knew I still was young and, heavy-hearted, stepped aside,<br>
“Apologies, I must depart,<br>
Though it is sure you’ll have my heart,<br>
One night, I’ve yet to play the part,<br>
Set for me in the Works my Lord had writ as His command,<br>
I dried her eyes, and later prized her kiss upon my hand,<br>
My token troth that I would keep,<br>
Her in my prayers, and one night sweep,<br>
Her ‘round this hall again and sleep,<br>
Beside her in the fields, to keep her comp’ny come the light.

And to this day for her I pray, for she had ever meant me love,<br>
Her arms enlaced to my embrace when one night I’m no longer young,<br>
And hence adrift her stygian gift those del’cate, pallid fingers call,<br>
I’ll remember I danced with her, and to her shimm’ring darkness fall.
