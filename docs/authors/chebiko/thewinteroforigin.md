The summer was long and our trees grew tall<br>
We maybe thought the summer would not end at all<br>
We deemed ourselves safe behind the cracked wall<br>
We had forgotten; after summer comes the fall<br>

High trees catch a lot of wind<br>
And now our forest has been thinned<br>
The Indigo Tears will keep falling for years<br>
The loss was great, but not the darkest of fears<br>
The fire had burned and cold wind was blowing<br>
But the embers of our spirits still remained glowing<br>

The Stitcher said<br>
It’s not so bad.<br>
With needle and thread<br>
We will patch this hole<br>
Once more become whole<br>
We still have our soul<br>
We’ll climb back to the top<br>
We’re not going to stop<br>
or let our spirits drop<br>

But on Renaissance the mountains are high<br>
And there were some who could not help but cry<br>
Yet we were hopeful, soon would come spring<br>
We were looking forward to what future might bring<br>
But wind kept blowing, chilled the embers in our heart<br>
And like leaves of dead trees we were blown apart<br>
As some searched respite under different skies<br>
They never returned to see the Isis sunrise<br>

Even The Stitcher said 't is the end of the show<br>
The mountains are covered under far too much snow<br>
Those of you who remain here just have no place to go<br>

A few of us keep holding out and still hope for the thaw<br>
But there’s no denying that winter comes after the fall
