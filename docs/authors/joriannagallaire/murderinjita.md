Awful Crime in Jita 4-4, Murder of Mrs. Starkwinter, a most respected and reputed member of the high circles in the Caldari society was found dead after disappearing from a gala night one week ago.

We saw the body after she had been laid out and hope never to see another such sight. Mrs. Starkwinter’s face was cut in two with a powerful blow from a sharp object, which divided the nose, crosswise, and out open the face entirely across, crashing through the bones of the upper jaw and cheeks. Over the right eye was another gash, sinking through the skull and into the brain; and there was another which cut open the side and back of the head, and a great gash near the right temple. Besides these wounds there were others made by probably a knife, one through the lower part of the chin, the blade penetrating deep into the throat; one deep into the right breast; and another deep one in the left breast.

The investigator also told me they found whip marks all over her back and cutting on her legs that seems to have been applied some time before the final mutilation of the body.<br>
Even if some people might have seen Mrs. Starkwinter as an old racist and has probably been stepping over bodies to reach her goals, enormous wealth and power, this is not the way anyone deserves to end his life.

Any leads on this is welcomed by the authorities, and a substantial reward for information that leads to an arrest is issued.
