See & Hear, Intaki, 1/1/YC124

A mural from the hand of none other than Saccade Amir has found its way back into the limelight. It is well documented that the piece with the Olives was a gift from the Artist formerly known best for her Trigonometry exhibit a year and a half ago, to the proprietor of the Gallente Lounge, none other than the Illustrious James Syagrius.

The piece itself depicts an Olive orchard, with most olives decorated with pained and screaming faces, uncovered genitalia and other expressive artistic licenses that Miss Amir is best known for. It decorated the Lounge for a good half a year before mysteriously disappearing from the Capsuleer-haven’s bar overlooking the Crystal Boulevard.
Rumour has it that much to Miss Amir’s dismay, no one has conferred with the artist about the painting’s fate. The management of the Gallente Lounge has been tightlipped and gave no comments whether or not the security footage showed any evidence as to the paintings abductors.
Was it painted over? Was it lasered off? Who knows. Today word reached See and Hear, that we might finally know what became of the piece best known as ‘Screaming Sexual Olives’

Now however, a large piece of armoured concrete wall has appeared in the Caille Museum of Modern Art. The fragment of wall is encased in a clear resin block, showing a depiction of sexually active Olives. It is even more strangely, the centerpiece of an exhibition on Street Art. Among other well known graffiti artists, whose pieces have all been cut out of the buildings and walls they were placed on originally, Miss Amir’s stands out as being one of few artists in the exhibit whose Identity is known.

Experts have congregated at the exhibit to try and determine whether or not the concrete is a match with the Aidonis Elabon building’s, and whether or not the paint and techniques used are similar to Miss Amir’s. They seem unanimous in their decision that this is, in fact, an Amir Original.

The director of the museum could only express their gratitude to whomever donated the artwork but wouldn’t reveal the identity of the gracious donator. ‘’It is amazing to have a piece from someone as well known as Miss Amir in our collection.’’ was the director’s closing remark.
