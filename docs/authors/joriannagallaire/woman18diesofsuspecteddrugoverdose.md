An 18-year-old woman has died from a suspected drug overdose in Caille, the second such death in the city over the weekend.

The police said the teenager was taken to hospital after collapsing at the Warehouse club in the old city centre. Officers were notified the General Infirmary at 3.18am and she died a short time later, the force said.

A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a new Khuska-based drug, called “Tangle” and remained in police custody.

Mrs Wimb of the Caille police said: “Taking illegal substances is incredibly dangerous and I would urge anyone considering doing so to think twice before doing so. We are supporting the family of the deceased.”

The death comes just 48 hours after a 17-year-old girl died from a suspected Khuska-based drug overdose at another club.

Following her death, a 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of supplying the drug and later released under investigation.

The deaths will increase concerns about the rising strength, purity and widespread availability of this so-called new party drug.

Police had issued a warning about “very dangerous, high strength” substance called “Tangle”, which officers said contained “up to five times the normal average adult dose of Khuska oil, but is modified into a solid powder form that is taken in pills or in drinks”.
