> Entry for YC121 New Eden Capsuleerâ€™s Writing Contest in the Poetry category.


My spirit 'ere is drawn,<br>
Pouring forth fire and mist,<br>
Awakened upon the dawn,<br>
Reaching out claw and fist,<br>
To draw up this cold shell,<br>
The same who calleth forth,<br>
With crimson upon the stone,<br>
And candles flicker to North.

This life here is spent,<br>
Stains upon the stone,<br>
For this I hath been sent,<br>
Devouring flesh and bone.<br>
The spirit, damned, lingers<br>
Confused, forlorn, and alone.<br>
A twisted tree with limbs and fingers,<br>
Awaits her soul, and tortured moan.

This pool of time ripples now,<br>
These footsteps heavy fall,<br>
Reaching forth her soul to tow,<br>
And pull her in this cursed hall.<br>
"Abandon all hope", I gently whisper,<br>
"Ye who enter here."<br>
Her hand reaches forth, as it were,<br>
Knowing fate, yet without fear.

And thus her soul I carry affixed,<br>
Held in these wicked arms,<br>
Wading through the river Styx,<br>
Fearing neither malice nor harm.<br>
Neither shall her soul be forgotten,<br>
Borne upon immortal wings.
