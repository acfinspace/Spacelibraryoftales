### 1.

My Life<br>
Came like an asteroid belt<br>
Disappeared like an asteroid belt<br>
All of Providence<br>
Is a dream after dream.

### 2.

With my foe unvanquished, I will not parish from this world<br>
I’ll be born again, to take up the sword 9 times more<br>
As long as Providence lives<br>
So will its defenders<br>

### 3.

Las beams bright as the sun<br>
Fly through space as a fiery arrow<br>
Pray for armor’s cycle run<br>
Hold fast thy mighty Prow<br>

### 4.

The Frigate<br>
Out in the good, wide space that seems so deep,<br>
The pride of Provi’s ships lie with their thunderous guns asleep.<br>
Men will speak of the great ships like the mighty Amarrian Abaddon,<br>
Few songs are song of smaller ones which gusto seems so deaden.<br>

The First line ships park lazily on the Keepstar’s Space,<br>
The proudest ships that ever honored Empress with such grace.<br>
Now down the line on furthest tether lay the soft skin wrecks,<br>
Here lies the little Frigates with its disrupters on its decks.<br>

Now boast your songs and chanteys to the ends of New Eden,<br>
Stand tall Amarrian banners which honors cannot deafen.<br>
Mind you well to tell this tale beneath this noble sky,<br>
Give honor to the Frigate that was not too small to die.<br>
