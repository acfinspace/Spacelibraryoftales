Priests say I must not hate, but I wont pretend.<br>
What Recking Crew has done to my Providence Friends.

The Scars you left on our hearts and souls will take time to fade.<br>
Oh, if I had your cruel hart, my vengeance will not bade.

I must control my mind and soul and not give into the rage.<br>
I must control the fight from here, and not yeet into a cage.

Yet you will do, no doubt, for your heart is so cruel.<br>
You revel in the pain you cause, for you are no fool.

In the name of God and Empire, you’re all that I despise.<br>
You planned to take by treachery my home as your prize.

My Margrave, my friends, my people- all you plotted to despoil.<br>
But by Gods grace and faith enabled us to foil!

I must control my fury or it will undo all I sought.<br>
Vengeance would not be enough for the evils that you brought.

God grant this day you fall beneath the fleets of me and mine.<br>
Drink fully of defeat that cold and bitter wine.

Our Empress blessings are like a shield, upon our very souls.<br>
Our god, country, liberty, is our only goals.

Our fleets are like eager slaverhounds awaiting divine command.<br>
By our guns and launchers your life is in our hands.

Our oaths and grudges are old and long for which we wont forget.<br>
For if you cross our laws, the status red you shall beget.

Your lists of crimes and bigotry are as clear as a noon-day sun.<br>
With how you taunted, killed, and lied, you thought that was so fun.

By all the Stars that ever shone,<br>
By all the gods ever known,<br>
For Margrave and the Empress’ Own.<br>
I swear this day you pay!
