Every single one in gods light<br>
Sets a blaze if they burn together<br>
Every cycle and every fight<br>
Standing side by side forever<br>
Branched we will fall undivided we will stand<br>
An uprising is at hand

We are stars glowing in the sky<br>
Illuminate the dark in gods shining light<br>
If we were sparkles, flying in the gust<br>
Blazing in the fight, ignite the flame within

Every omission we have ever made<br>
Show that we are only human<br>
Every truth which it takes<br>
Gives us hope at least for the moment<br>
For better or for worse<br>
Together in gods light, time will be until the end

If we were hearts beating in one chest<br>
Pounding like a drum holding our faith<br>
If we were words ending in a rhyme<br>
Written in a book to stand the test of time
