Among capsuleers the age-old proverb *appearances can be deceiving* holds true more often than not. Grizzled pilot Quedragan en Gravonere, veteran ex-rebel turned bar tender and small-business owner, nicely exemplifies this point. These days you’ll find him socializing and mixing drinks at The Star Traveler’s Lounge, adroitly serving up cheap yet strong libations to the seemingly endless stream of tourists, a veritable army of holidaymakers, who arrive at the Intaki system each day. For years locals have known “The Dragon” as he has been called by friend and foe alike for as long as anyone can remember as nothing more than the good-natured proprietor and their host at this popular dive bar anchored just outside the Astral Mining Refinery station orbiting the Intaki Homeworld.

Quedragan, however, once served a very different kind of army, though he is long since retired from that line of work; except for a handful of his compadres of old, long-in-the-tooth Intaki freedom fighters who can’t seem to let it go - which he understands perfectly, not being one to judge, in any case - a small cadre of whom are regulars at the lounge, besides them, few others are privy to his former life as an Intaki Liberation Front covops scout, spy, and saboteur. Nowadays to most visitors he is no one in particular or at most a quiet man of mystery, and he prefers it that way, intentionally cultivating the perception, only rarely choosing to regale a group of lucky revelers with exploits of his fiery youth, and usually then only after having thrown back a few too many glasses of zydrine wine, his favorite poison, near closing time.
