We bring you breaking news from within the past 24 hours.

A refinery belonging to Valentine Drone Design of DammFam has been reinforced in the Frarn system in the region of Heimatar.

A pirate coalition of R I O T and Pain and Compliance hit the refinery in the later hours. This follows what appears to be an organised attack on DammFam mining operations during wartime.

Ushra’Khan has joined the war on the side of their close allies DammFam.

Komi Valentine, CEO of Valentine Drone Design, tells us that diplomacy was attempted with these pirates with the offer of shares in the refinery itself - the refinery being crowdfunded - however, there has been no response from either pirate outfit.

In the hours before the refinery came out of reinforced, Komi Valentine issued the following statement:

"There is nothing so desperately monotonous as space, and i no longer wonder at the cruelty of capsuleer pirates.
They are walking all over civilians to fulfil their greedy ambitions, but we have allies and this refinery will be like a wall - they will not step over.
I assure everyone there is no need for dismay. It is my personal responsibility that the residents of this beautiful station will not lose their homes."

This is the second attack on the DammFam refinery in as many days. In the evening of the 24th of April, Ushra’Khan and DammFam coalition members had expected heavy combat in the area - fully expecting a final attack on the refinery.
The second defence took place at the 11th hour on the 25th of April. Our camera team caught footage of multiple Praxis class battleships belonging to Pain and Compliance landing on the refinery. Appearing in jubilant mood, they put on a display of fireworks as cruise missiles rained down upon the refinery.

A second Praxis class battleship belonging to R I O T landed on the refinery shortly after. It was at this point a Tornado class battleship fleet commanded by Tankbuster arrived. The DammFam Tornado fleet made multiple long range strike attempts against the Praxis fleets. However, they proved hard to break and a change of tactics was called by the DammFam fleet commander as they came under fire.

An Oneiros class Logistics vessel piloted by Kabuoto of R I O T was engaged at range whilst in close proximity of the station. In a matter of seconds, the Oneiros was destroyed, as a Tornado piloted by Ralt Gaithar of Dammfam succumbed to the overwhelming strengths of the Praxis fleets.

With the combined Pain and Compliance and R I O T Praxis fleets maintaining an unbreakable chain of defence, it was not long before the refinery lost its armour. It now sits in its final stage of reinforcement. DammFam fully expect the pirate coalition to make an assault this coming Saturday the 30th of April at 4pm.

We will be broadcasting live on the scene as the action unfolds. Komi Valentine has declared a state of emergency:

"We will start the evacuation of the civilian population immediately. Shuttles will be provided to fly people and goods to the Brutor station.
We ask capsuleer pilots in the vicinity to help complete the transport orders - they will be available as public orders and through the Pandora agency.
Hopelessness is already the anticipated defeat. Therefore, let us hope."

We have approached both R I O T and Pain and Compliance, but, as yet, have had no response.

This concludes our breaking news report. Please join us this Saturday 10 in the lead up to 5pm. See you there.
