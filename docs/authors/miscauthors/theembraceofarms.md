I was naught but dust,<br>
And by His will was molded arms,<br>
These vestments of my joys and harms,<br>
My writs upon Creation. Pray,<br>
I’ve given by them more than stolen,<br>
Soothed and healed more than I’ve broken,<br>
So when my final prayers are spoken,<br>
Find me worthy, take mine arms away,

What wisdom lifts, these burdens weigh.

For were these ever tools of man,<br>
To throw our sunlight ‘cross the skies?<br>
Those shining perriwinks of Light,<br>
Which birthed a million stars again,<br>
In Delve, in Curse, and in Anath?<br>
Is righteousness such simple math,<br>
And damnation a callous graph,<br>
Of grace and evil? Love and sin?

And are we not our bogeymen?

Across these plantings cast Thine eyes,<br>
For ‘neath the grass we laid I see,<br>
A hundred thousand families,<br>
Whole lines? Whole blood? We amortize,<br>
These children lain by parents’ sides,<br>
These heroes slain we lionized,<br>
These friends whose murder justifies,<br>
Our bloodshed. Or our bloodlust?

And could we ever spill enough?

For if our arms see to our peace,<br>
Then shall our fields be watered red,<br>
With all these drops our people bled,<br>
Our anger come their altarpiece?<br>
And on these graves their epitaph:<br>
Here lay the faithful of Anath,<br>
Hence cast aside like common chaff,<br>
God bless us with our enemies!

Is all our vengeance as we please?

Oh, has it ever been our way,<br>
To bless our pain with monuments,<br>
Our anguish an inheritance,<br>
We pass to those who bear our names,<br>
And shall our children be undone,<br>
Upon our altars to the gun,<br>
Their songs of love and life unsung,<br>
A sacrifice? Some debt repaid?

Shall all our unborn be our blade?

Oh God, I’ve begged You in my prayers,<br>
You’ve burdened mine with surety,<br>
And righteousness and purity,<br>
To answer for our suff’ring heirs,<br>
But what if answers never come?<br>
What if all my faith is just some,<br>
Vestige of my family? Some,<br>
Product of the signs I wear?

What can I do? Am I so weak?

Though anger welled deep in my core,<br>
It could not be for else to share,<br>
The weight of hate was mine to bear,<br>
Peace was theirs, my word foreswore,<br>
For God hath bid us by our hands,<br>
‘To Cultivate the Souls of Man,’<br>
To sow our harvest, He commands,<br>
But mine arms tire, my heart hurts.

Pray can’t You lift these arms from me?

For what eternal sleep must be,<br>
But labors’ end, and answers come?<br>
Rewards for what my work has done,<br>
Should I not welcome eagerly?<br>
My brethrens’ mis’ries on my soul,<br>
Cut heavy, and though I extol,<br>
To bear our pain with smiles, so,<br>
I find mine own so meagerly.

Were all who wore the chain so frail?

And is it meant that I should fail?<br>
To fall down to my knees and scream,<br>
That if these arms are Yours then deem,<br>
Me worthy of Your strength’s avail!<br>
Please leave me not to break alone,<br>
In constellations far from home,<br>
Among these regiments of stones,<br>
The toll of fools and arms we veiled.

Or is my weakness selfish sloth?

For have You not blessed me with love,<br>
The same as lost beneath my feet?<br>
And when I rise at last replete,<br>
With grace, shall I not reflect of,<br>
My brothers, sisters, cousins, friends?<br>
The wines my uncle recommends?<br>
Flirtatious steps while music mends,<br>
My grief? Shall we yet dance above?

And is this what it is to preach?

To serve unshakably and reach,<br>
For greatness? Shall I face this wraith,<br>
Clad in the armor of my faith,<br>
And see this evil finds no breach?<br>
To raise a sword of Godly Word,<br>
And wield it among those who heard,<br>
The Horn of Heaven and were stirred,<br>
To offer shoulders while I teach?

It cannot be my right to fall!

I’m too far blessed to justly crawl!<br>
And by the price these fields have paid,<br>
We can but toil all our days,<br>
To face our en’mies as a wall!<br>
And where I’m healed in love’s embrace,<br>
Some shall not feel nor leave a trace,<br>
And in their loneliness misplace,<br>
Their days in misanthropic thrall.

And so I shall not beg release.

My works are Yours alone to cease,<br>
Nor should I pray within these lines,<br>
That we who lived to see such times,<br>
Would find Creation come caprice,<br>
Though evil born in man lies deep,<br>
Our agonies, the friends we keep,<br>
And for our faith, the price is steep,<br>
Tonight, Your starlight brings me Peace.

Pray, let me sleep a little longer in Her arms…
