Wrecks left on a gate<br>
Echoes of violence past<br>
My salvage drones feast!<br>

Hunting with D-Scan<br>
Elite wrecks found on a gate<br>
Salvager cycles<br>

A battle raged here<br>
Cold wrecks now litter this space<br>
After me?  No trace.<br>

I follow the kills -<br>
Null-sec promised many wrecks.<br>
