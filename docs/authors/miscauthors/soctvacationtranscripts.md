Hello everybody, I hope you’re all doing good.

For services above and beyond the call of duty, ‘Central Administration’ has graciously booked a 2 week all expense paid vacation for me onboard the SoCT Luxury Spaceliner “Equinox”.

I’ve just checked in and been assigned a VIP Stateroom Cabin which comes complete with all amenities a Capsuleer could ever need. I must say the Ships Crew is very polite and respectful, treating all passengers like they were Royalty. The ship serves top of the line Cuisine and Beverages from all sectors of New Eden, always available with Room Service.

There are lot’s of different on-board activities as well, such as Holoreel Theaters, Laser Skeet Shooting, Communal Meditation Rooms, Therapeutic Spa Centers, Dance Studios and Novice Instructional Seminars, all hosted by famous personal Trainers who are well-known throughout New Eden.

The itinerary for the first week will include stops at various well known Landmarks such as ‘The Bonfire’ along with some other lesser known locations like ‘Space Stonehenge’. The first part of the Tour route will travel through ‘Four Points Junction’, a group of 4 Acceleration Gates that lead to each Empire’s sector. That location also provides an excellent up-close view of the ‘Cloud Ring Nebula’.

The end of the first week will include an overnight stop at ‘Midpoint Station’, known for having some of the best Gambling and Pleasure Lounges within New Eden.

Needless to say I’m sure this all expense paid vacation will be a lot of fun. I will definitely keep you updated and send you another message asap.

Hi everybody, so far this vacation is going great.

The Tour route this first week included stops at some very famous locations, specifically ‘Eve Gate’ and ‘Black Monolith’. If you’ve never seen those sites before then I urge you to do so asap. They’re very impressive and definitely something you will never forget.

During our approach to ‘Midpoint Station’, all Passengers were notified on internal comms that our overnight stay has been extended into a 48 hour layover due to inclement travel conditions. When asked about it, the Cruise Director just said it’s standard operating procedure and not to worry about it.

My Cabin Steward has just informed me that docking procedures have been completed with ‘Midpoint Station’. Luckily since this is an all expense paid vacation, I plan to spend a lot of time visiting the Gambling and Pleasure Lounges located inside the station.

I gotta say this vacation is turning into a very memorable and enjoyable experience. I’ll definitely keep you all updated and will send another message asap.

Hello everyone, unfortunately I don’t have much sightseeing to report.

A few hours after leaving ‘Midpoint Station’, ship speed was greatly reduced due to hazardous traveling conditions. The Cruise Director informed us that the ship is traveling along a rarely used route known as ‘The Titanic Trail’.

The route takes us right through the middle of a large thick Cosmic Dust Cloud filled with multiple asteroids spread throughout the interior. It is adversely affecting both navigation and communications which is the reason for the reduced speed.

We’ve been traveling through it now for over 24 hours. There’s very limited visibility due to the Heavy Space Fog and we have no idea when it will clear up. Every few hours an alarm will activate and a voice on the intercom will say “Berg off the Port Bow” or “Berg to Starboard”.

The Cruise Director has issued ‘Lifeboat’ numbers to everybody and whenever anyone asks about it, all he says is it’s nothing to worry about, just standard operating procedure.

Despite the reassurances from the Cruise Director, the overall feeling on-board seems to be a little uneasy. In fact all of the ships Communal Meditation Rooms and Therapeutic Centers are packed, probably due to Passengers feeling a bit apprehensive.

I gotta say I find this whole situation very exciting. I’ll send you another message asap when there is more to report.

Hi everybody, SoCT has informed me there was some technical problems with my last message. Here’s a quick recap in case it was lost.

After slow boating through the Heavy Space Fog with almost no visibility for 36 hours, most of the Passengers were starting to get very uneasy. All of a sudden the fog cleared and much to everyone’s surprise, directly in front of us was the ‘Tomb Of Divine Point’. It was a very heartfelt solemn moment for all Passengers on-board.

Legend states this ancient site was erected century’s ago, pointing the way to sanctuary for all weary lost travelers to follow. Of course we headed in the direction indicated by the Tomb. I must say that whole sector of space invokes a strange sense of reverence, at times almost becoming eerie. Even the various Rock Formations seem to convey that feeling.

Eventually we encountered an abandoned ‘Ancient Monastery’ now occupied by a small group of Maintenance Drones. According to the Cruise Director, it’s the sanctuary that the Tomb pointed all weary lost travelers to century’s ago.

The Cruise Director has just informed all Passengers that the ship is now locked onto the Beacon for the last part of this Tour. I will definitely keep you updated and send another message asap.

Hello everybody, the Cruise Director has just announced we will be back at SoCT’s Docking Berth within 24 hours so this will be my last SoCT Data Transmission.

After leaving the ‘Ancient Monastery’, we arrived at a Beacon known as ‘The Crossroads’. That area contains 8 Acceleration Gates all grouped together. There’s very few areas within New Eden like that so it was great to view it.

The sector of space we’re in now seems to invoke a sense of peace and serenity, sorta like being in a Tropical Paradise. Definitely a big difference compared to the last sector of space. All the Passengers are feeling very relaxed and joyful.

Currently there’s a ‘Parade Of Ships’ shooting off all kinds of Fireworks while escorting us back to SoCT’s Docking Berth. It’s a site to behold which is making everybody on-board feel like VIP’s.

I really enjoyed this vacation and plan to go on another cruise soon. I gotta say if you’ve never been on an SoCT Cruise before, you should do so asap. It’s an experience you’ll never forget.
