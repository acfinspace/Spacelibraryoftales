Adrift in the dark,<br>
I am captured by your radiance.<br>

As you pull me in,<br>
I crack open my icy shell.<br>

Bursting into dust,<br>
I shed the crust of old history.<br>

The trail that follows me<br>
Enthrals you like a beacon to pull me closer.<br>

We dance;<br>
Our entwined splendour outshining your companions.<br>

We join,<br>
In a fleeting moment that almost burns me to crisp.<br>

We separate,<br>
Both knowing I cannot call your sky my own.<br>

I drift away from your warm embrace,<br>
As my trail fades away.<br>

I leave your sky to truer orbits,<br>
My love now sheltered away.<br>

I wonder,<br>
As I face the dark once more;<br>

Heart captured,<br>
But not kept:<br>

Will we ever meet like this again?<br>
