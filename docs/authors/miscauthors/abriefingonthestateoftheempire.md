Briefing on the State of the Empire
By Chapter Master Gaven Lok’ri
Excubitoris Chapter of the Order of the Sacred Throne
MAY 20, YC 123

Over the reign of our current Emperor the Sacred Throne, the Empress Catiz
I, the state of the Amarr Empire has shifted dramatically. Externally, we face both
new threats and revitalised old ones. Internally, we are in the midst of a process of
mass militarisation and reorganization, the likes of which have not been seen since the
Moral Reforms. We also face a variety of new heretical challenges to the sanctity of
Holy Amarr. The future of Amarr remains bright, but we must remain vigilant and
adaptive. This document is intended to bring those new to the pod up to date on the
current state of the Amarr Empire.
1 THE REUNITED EMPIRE AND THE MILITARY CIRCUITS
The single largest change in the state of the Empire is the promulgation of the
Pax e Kilizhe Do “The Peace of Two Swords” on September 27, YC 121.1 This
document represents a sweeping reorganisation of the Empire. It replaced the
centralised naval structure developed by the Emperor Heideran VII, blessed be his
memory, which had been in effect since YC 105 and prioritised a strong centrally
organised Imperial Navy and a restriction on the naval forces of Holders and Heirs.2
The changes caused by this shift represent a radical reorganisation of the Empire and
mean that much of the CONCORD provided information accessible from the
capsule-interface is out of date. This section outlines the major changes that have
resulted from that shift.

1.1 THE SHAPE OF REORGANISATION

Figure 1 Political Map of the Military Circuits. Map made by Amicia Cora.
The Pax e Kilizhe Do reorganised the Amarr Empire into seven Military Circuits.
These circuits are constituted as follows:
• The Throne Military Circuit. This consists of the Throne Worlds and the
Norgoh Imperial Zone. It is directly under the command of the Empress, who
is the official Sword Marshal of the Throne Military Circuit. Our organisation
falls under this Military Circuit.
• The Ardishapur Military Circuit. This consists of Lower Domain,
Derelik, and the Lower Rebel Provinces. This is overseen by Sword Marshal
Arim Ardishapur.
• The Sarum Military Circuit. This consists of Upper Domain, Bleak
Lands, Devoid and the Upper Rebel Provinces. This is overseen by Sword
Marshal Arrach Sarum.
• The Tash-Murkon Military Circuit. This consists of Tash-Murkon, the
Jakemhih-Kashag Development Zone and the Providence Marches. This is
overseen by Sword Marshal Tunir Tash Murkon.
• The Kador Military Circuit. This consists of Kador and Lower Genesis.
It is overseen by Sword Marshal Hamideh Kador.

• The Kor-Azor Military Circuit. This consists of Kor-Azor and Upper
Genesis. It is overseen by Sword Marshal Ersilia Kor-Azor
• The Khanid Military Circuit. This consists of Khanid and Arida. It is
overseen by Sword Marshal Farokh Khanid.
1.2 REINTEGRATIONS
This change means that the CONCORD sovereignty information for the
regions of Khanid and Derelik is no longer accurate. The Ammatar Mandate is now a
direct vassal of the Ardishapur Military Circuit, rather than a semi-independent entity.
The so-called Khanid Kingdom is also no longer in rebellion and has been
reintegrated into the Amarr Empire command structure as the Khanid Military
Circuit.
1.3 MASS MILITARISATION
Each of the Sword Marshals has been given a mandate to build up their navy to
the point that it can provide a substantial aid to the Amarr Empire in times of war.
The Khanid Navy is the most far along on this process, as it was never subject to the
Heideran Decree, but all of the other Sword Marshals have spent the last two years
catching up. This represents a major shift in the vibrancy of the navy’s loyal to the
Throne, but also means that each Sword Marshal now has substantially more personal
military power than they did three years ago.
1.4 INCREASED REPUBLIC TENSIONS
The inclusion of the Lower and Upper Rebel Provinces in the organisational
system of the Pax e Kilizhe Do represents a claim on territory that currently is part of
the Minmatar Republic. While the Ardishapur Military Circuit has mostly handled this
through peaceful negotiations, the Sarum Military Circuit has escalated the conflict
with the Republic by restarting slave taking operations in Republic Space. The largest
flashpoint for this new conflict has been the system of Floseswin, which has seen
major planetary military conflict over the course of YC 122.
1.5 INCREASED IMPORTANCE OF MILITARY ORDERS
One of the changes that has occurred in the last few years is that the Military
Orders have seen a revitalised role in the defense of the Amarr Empire. The Order of
Tetrimon, a conservative order that is associated with suicidal zeal and a strong
resistance to change has been given an Empire wide mandate to seek out and destroy

Heresy.3 Also, in YC 120, the Empress created a new Chapter of the Sacred Throne
Order, an old order that was no longer militarised, and granted the Emperor Family
loyal Paramilitary PIE Inc. membership in it.4 This gives the Sacred Throne Order a
great deal more firepower than they have had for some time. While these are
significantly smaller militarisations than the ones seen with the Military Circuits, they
are part of the same trend of the Empire arming against threats both internal and
external.

2 EXTERNAL THREATS
Over the last decades, a wide variety of external threats have threatened the
Amarr Empire. These range from old threats—such as Sansha’s Nation and the
Minmatar Republic—to new emergent threats such as the Drifters and Triglavians.
2.1 THE MINMATAR REPUBLIC
The Republic that developed in the aftermath of the Minmatar Rebellion is also
a signatory to the CONCORD agreement along with Amarr. Over the course of the
last century they fought a long, bloody, war with the Ammatar mandate that only
ended in YC 104. There were 6 years of official peace, followed by a coup that
removed the less belligerent Minmatar from power. In YC 110 a group called the
Elder Network invaded into Amarr space, after having disabled CONCORD, and
were only stopped at the Throne Worlds themselves.5 Once defences were restored,
the four CONCORD signatories agreed upon a limited war in set CONCORD
mandate warzones. This conflict was designed to be an equal drain on all power’s
resources, which in practice penalised the smaller states that had been the aggressors

in the war of June 10, YC110. While the Gallente-Caldari war has tended towards de-
escalation, the Matari-Amarr war has heated up in the last year and looks likely to

keep escalating at any moment. Republic loyalists have also been repeatedly involved
in attempts at causing internal strife within the Amarr Empire.6 While the Republic on

its own is not an existential threat to Amarr, the strong support they receive from the
Gallente Federation forces this conflict into a dangerous stalemate.
2.2 SANSHA’S NATION
In May of YC 112 Sansha’s Nation revitalised and launched a major series of
attacks on the CONCORD states.7 They exploited weaknesses created by the
development of wormholes throughout the cluster to attack the Empires. While the
vibrancy of the initial attacks has passed, they remain a clear external threat against
which we must stay on guard at all times.
2.3 THE DRIFTERS
With the opening of wormholes in YC 111, the Empire encountered a
seemingly Jove-related civilisation that ran automated ships throughout the
wormholes. In YC 117, a more aggressive branch of this group known as the Drifters,
launched an offensive against the Amarr Empire that culminated in the death of the
Blessed Empress Jamyl I.8 The Empire declared war on the Drifters as a result, and
seems to have successfully repulsed their attacks. However, we still do not fully
understand this enemy and need to continually be on guard.
2.4 THE TRIGLAVIANS
Over the course of the last year (YC 122) another Jove-related group started an
assault on the CONCORD signatories. Using strange technology, they were able to
effectively steal stars from our space and create a new region now known as
Pochven.9 They were opposed by EDENCOM, a CONCORD organised defence
group consisting of forces from all four Empires. In Amarr space, the Imperial Navy,
well prepared for a threat of this nature after the Drifter War, did extremely well and
only lost four systems. However, our allies, the Caldari State, were caught flat footed
with devastating results, losing 15 systems. This represents a major blow to the much
smaller entity and seems likely to destabilise CONCORD.

The height of the conflict seems to have settled for now, but the rescue of
Kuharah, Harva, Raravoss, and Niarja from the Svarog Triglavians should be an
operation of utmost priority.
2.5 NEED FOR MILITARISATION
The sheer number of external enemies we face at this time demonstrates the
absolute importance of the Pax e Kilizhe Do’s call for mass militarisation of the Amarr
Empire. We have more untapped resources than any other state in New Eden and we
need to take full advantage of that to survive in this unstable and dangerous
environment.

3 INTERNAL ENEMIES
The most dangerous threats to the Empire, however, are not the external ones,
but rather the internal threats of disorder and heretical corruption. The main internal
threat to the Empire remains the Sani Sabik heresy, especially Omir Sarakusa’s “Blood
Raiders,” but recently the Equilibrium of Mankind has joined them in creating major
internal problems for the Empire.
3.1 THE BLOOD RAIDERS
The Sani Sabik have been a threat to Amarr for millennia. In their most recent
incarnation, that of the Blood Raiders, they have cut a swathe of destruction across
several regions and have even been responsible for the death of an Emperor. In YC
107, the Blood Raiders attacked the planet Mabnen with a psychoactive agent that
drove the planet into mass rebellion. When this rebellion was repressed, the Empire
declared war and drove the heretics out of the Bleak Lands. However, the Sani Sabik
had suborned the Imperial Chamberlain Karsoth and were able to assassinate the
Emperor Doriam.10 The Blood Chamberlain remained in control for the following
three years, and was only ousted with the events of the Elder Invasion of YC 110.
While the Empress Jamyl I led a major purge of the Imperial Bureaucracy, cells of
Sani Sabik supporters must be assumed to still be active at all levels to which Karsoth
had access.

In YC 118, the same tactic was repeated on a much larger scale, with major
attacks hitting six planets.11 It is still assumed that these attacks were caused by Blood
Raiders, though the recent events with the Equilibrium of Mankind throw that
hypothesis into doubt.
3.2 THE EQUILIBRIUM OF MANKIND
The Equilibrium of Mankind is a 1500 year old heresy derived from an extreme
set of beliefs that demand for the destruction of all of humanity. While they are much
smaller in scale than the Blood Raiders, they have recently managed to do a great deal
of damage and forced a major escalation in tensions between the Empires.
On May 5 YC 123, a set of Equilibrium of Mankind dreadnaughts and a Titan
piloted by the Khanid Duke, Khanid Plenipotentiary Spokesperson, and Theology
Council Member Alar Chakaid attacked the Planet Kahah III.12 This was after a series
of false flag operations that were clearly intended to force an escalation into outright
warfare between the CONCORD signatories.
While this escalation seems to have failed, the unmasking of Alar Chakaid as a
major heretic leader is at once unsurprising and chilling. The Excubitoris Chapter has
suspected Alar Chakaid of Heresy since the Succession Trials before the beginning of
the Empress Catiz’s reign, and evidence has steadily piled up since then. Despite this,
he was promoted repeatedly into ever more prominent roles within the Khanid
Military Circuit and Theology Council. Uncovering and destroying the network of
support that enabled him to act in such a horrific manner for so long needs to be a
primary objective for maintaining the stability of the Amarr Empire.
4 CONCLUDING REMARKS
The reorganisation of the Empire outlined in section one is an important
positive development for hardening it against the threats outlined in sections three

and four. We must rise to these challenges and continue to work to create an Empire
that is too strong to successfully be attacked.
There will be many hardships in our path. Many threats and challenges that we
must face head on. But we will do so. We will surround ourselves with the faithful and
we will stand firm against the dark. If we maintain faith, we can only succeed, for we
have the Empress to lead us and destiny to follow.
