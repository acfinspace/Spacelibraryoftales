**Executive overview:**

The New Eden General Research Proposal would represent a dedication of resources to the study of the New Eden system and its various features, with the primary goal to be a complete and thorough survey and documentation of existing sites in the system and the generation of an accurate map of the local space-time topology of the system and nearby features.

In addition to this primary goal, multiple auxiliary goals are proposed as well, including regular observation of the nearby Jove Observatory, a planetary study of the remaining intact planetary body in the New Eden system, the active seeking of ancient wreckage from previous civilizations in system, and a special auxiliary project/set of projects dedicated to the EVE Gate. Currently there are multiple different “tiers” to the proposal, each having their own merits and detriments. These project “tiers” are covered later.

**Primary Goal/Mission:**

The proposal’s primary goal involves the anchoring of an Upwell engineering complex, in one of two primary locations. Either approximately 5-10AU directly above the central star in the New Eden system, or 20 AU away from the central star in the direct line of the EVE gate in a location near “JOANNA Gate Research” an Austrahaus class citadel which has been anchored at a similar distance. The choice of an engineering complex as opposed to a citadel was made in regards to operating costs of certain key facilities which would be used to research certain aspects of the New Eden system.

Once the Complex is anchored personnel would be begin work to generate a baseline gravitational and space-time map of the system, one that can be utilized to detect significant changes to local gravity and space-time, either by natural or artificial means. The expected time this process will take is unknown at this time, but estimates propose that no more than 2 standard years would be required generate a map of this type, however it might be longer before the map would be refined enough for use in detecting minor space-time defects and anomalies.

This baseline map would, in theory, prove key to the discovery of new phenomena should they appear, and would assist in the study of current phenomena as well. Once this baseline map has been established, onsite teams would be tasked with the monitoring of the system for major changes in this gravitational and space-time baseline, ones indicative of “larger than average” wormholes, new sites coming out of spatial distortions/cloaking system (like the Jove Observatories), or other similar events.

**Auxiliary Goal 1: Establishment of planetside research base and archeological team on New Eden I**

With an operating base in system from which to stage shipments as well from which reinforcements could be stationed, it wouldn’t be an impossible task to establish an initial research base on New Eden I. Given the planet’s barren nature and lack of exceptionally violent weather systems, it’s possible that remnants of previous civilizations may still be found on the planetary surface, or just below it.

Current data in public circulation has not documented any major attempts at research into this area, nor are there any documented expeditions on record with major empire historical archives, it’s possible such records have either been expunged or are not on record due to secrecy, however in the event that this is not the case, a dedicated effort may uncover new information, perhaps even ruins of what would have been our distant ancestors. Assuming any such ruins or information would be found, the data would be parsed locally at the engineering complex in system before being published at a later date.

Addendum: Given the nature of the planet, it’s not inconceivable that a full populated colony could be established after the research base has had time to do its work. Given the planet’s history, it’s possible it could be turned into a pilgrimage site for those looking to be closer to EVE gate, but are uncomfortable with staying on a capsuleer structure.

**Auxiliary Goal 2: Establishment of dedicated Jove Observatory research teams and Jovian engineering specialists**

The Jove Observatory located in the New Eden system, aside from the obvious implications of its existence, would remain a top priority for research personnel stationed in system. The Observatory itself appears to similar to all other Jovian Observatories found to date in other parts of the cluster, however its proximity to the EVE gate may mean it is more unique in ways we currently don’t understand, either through additional but minor engineering changes, or through specialized data collected that we haven’t been able to access with entosis systems. Even if this proves to not be the case, the in depth study of this structure may reveal more about them, or even allow us to salvage more data than previously thought, with an even more ambitious goal of “repairing” one of these massive systems, and attempting analysis of a potentially larger Jovian data system/network.

Addendum: The repair portion of the proposal is merely speculation at this point, as a repair of a system and structure of this size and complexity would be akin to repairing a badly damaged titan without a shipyard, not impossible, but certainly a monumental task…one compounded by both a lack of original blueprint for the systems involved, possibly exotic and hard to find materials (Antikythera Elements) and the constant damage being inflicted by drifter forces. On the note of drifter forces, dedicated combat pilots would need to be on hand to defend teams upon drifter arrivals…see Arataka Research Consortium about pilot training to combat them effectively.

**Auxiliary Goal 3: Establishment of expedition and recovery teams for Ancient Salvage and other technology**

Given the advanced nature of the EvE gate and its creation, along with the technological advancements present in Ancient Jovian technology, it remains a mystery in terms of what happened to those ships that were caught in the collapse event associated with the wormhole that the gate was meant to stabilize.

To date no official records have been released in regards to salvage operations conducted near the gate, nor in the New Eden system. Even if such efforts have been made in the past, a dedicated salvage team or set of teams may yet uncover possible ancient wrecks, or other items of note that have yet to be discovered. Such wrecks may contain technology of value, perhaps even more advanced than what we possess currently, even if this ultimately proves to not be the case, the items could be of immense historical value.

Addendum: Due to the implications of the acquisition of possibly advanced technology within what is considered “controlled” territory of the Amarr Empire there remains the open question of salvage rights and research rights to such finds, in addition to DED and CONCORD regulations. If such salvage teams are established, it may be worth reaching out to these entities about such concerns, or else taking extra steps to secure such information against outside leaks…

**Auxiliary Goal 4: Establishment of dedicated EVE gate research team and support facilities**

With the EVE gate being a primary feature of the New Eden system and the history behind the site, the site represents something of massive scientific interest to a number of interested parties. The establishment of a research lab fully dedicated to the gate and the space surrounding it is a logical step in the study of the system, as aside from the obvious interest there is in the gate, it would be necessary to study the gate in order to compensate for any effects the storms coming from the gate would have on the gravitational and space-time maps generated for scientific use.

There is also the fringe concerns of certain groups that in the coming decades the EVE gate may become the site of some sort of ruinous calamity to the cluster as per the obscure “seven events of the apocalypse.” Some believers interpret that the final event refers to the EVE gate. These groups have expressed interest in an “early warning system” of sorts, should something happen.

Addendum: It’s known that other groups have undertaken research into the EVE gate in the past, including the SOE and the Amarr Empire…would be of considerable help to have both of these groups, if not directly on board, then at the very least on good terms with those running the program.

**Proposal tiers and Financing**

Initial financing would be handled either by a small group of private individuals (Angel Donors), a corporate agreement with interested entities, or else by some type of public asset drive.<br>
Ongoing financing for the project would include utilizing the structure’s industrial capacity to produce goods for market sale back in Empire space, as well as the sale of blueprint copies made on site that are in high demand, invention and the production of advanced blueprints is also a possibility depending on availability of funds and market forces. In the event that industrial work is insufficient for project budget, it may be that an ongoing public donation drive is used to make up for budget shortfalls, in extreme scenarios it might that Empires are solicited for aid as well.

**Tier I**

Upwell Engineering complex “Raitaru”
Proposed budget:
5,000,000,000-7,500,000,000 ISK startup cost
6,000,000,000-8,000,000,000 Annual operating budget.
(Not including offset from Industrial/research products)

Auxiliary Goals 4 and 1 would be the priority on this tier of the project, in addition to the primary goals stated, as goals 1 and 4 represent those projects with the greatest chance at results.

**Tier II**

Upwell Engineering complex “Azbel”
Proposed budget:
15,000,000,000-20,000,000,000 ISK startup cost
6,000,000,000-8,000,000,000 Annual operating budget.
(Not including offset from Industrial/research products)

Auxiliary Goals 4, 1 and 2 would be the priority on this tier of the project, in addition to the primary goals stated, as goals 1 and 4 represent those projects with the greatest chance at results. Goal 2 while unlikely to produce results quickly, also holds great potential to revolutionize its associated fields.

**Tier III**

Upwell Engineering complex “Sotiyo”
Proposed budget:
65,000,000,000-75,000,000,000 ISK startup cost
6,000,000,000-8,000,000,000 Annual operating budget.
(Not including offset from Industrial/research products)

Auxiliary Goals: All stated goals, with emphasis on goals 1, 4, 2, 3 in that order in the event of budgetary shortfalls due the resource intensive natures of goals 2 and 3.

It should be noted that this proposal is far from final, additional Auxiliary Goals may still be proposed, and project parameters changed based on support from investors. This initial publishing acts as opportunity for the capsuleer community to help shape this project going forward. As of this time there is no proposed start date, however the sooner funding is secured, the sooner the project can move forward.
