Rumors Of I-RED Strike Force Against 2-M6DE Incursion Circulate
Selenna Solange • YC121.02.18

XS-XAY, Syndicate - It has been less than a month since the last Nation incursion into the region of Syndicate. Memories are still fresh in the minds of those who lost loved ones and their livelihoods in the constellation of JQV5-9. The area is still recovering from the incursion that disrupted the daily life of thousands in the area. Thus, it has been a shock to many in the region to see Nation mobilize yet another incursion a mere two constellations away.

I-RED leadership has been silent on the matter of the 2-M6DE incursion. The events centered around Semiki, and the 10th Anniversary celebrations have taken up much of the concern of the directorship. I-RED also invested heavy effort in a recent defense of their Fortizar anchored in the system of I0AB-R which was attacked by a mixed group of Imperium forces and others, mainly The Initiative [INIT.], Initiative Mercenaries [IM], and NullSechnaya Sholupen [-NSH-].

While I-RED does not operate any structures in the constellation of 2-6MDE, many outside spectators are curious to see if and when the organization will take a stance on the incursion. In the meantime, tabloids have been circulating rumors on various GalNet sites that I-RED intends to take formal action against the incursion. The sources of these claims have yet to be verified. I-RCN attempted to seek out a formal response by I-RED directorship, but has been denied for the time being.

Although no official military response has been confirmed, I-RED has began mobilizing relief efforts which are being spearheaded by Director of Public Works Roirdan Bouchate. Essentials such as food, water, medical supplies, and clothing are being gathered aboard the XS-XAY Reppola Logistic Support. Anyone interested in donating to the relief efforts of I-RED are encouraged to submit contracts to Director Bouchate in the citadel, or anywhere else in the region of Syndicate. Also being accepted are items such as manufacturing tools, titanium carbide sheet metal, smartfab units, and more.


A troubled figure of I-RED’s history re-emerges. Tabloids are quick to pick up on the concerns of those who remember…

Controversy Sparks As Sightings Of ‘Iron Lady’ Surface
Taigeru Beldeia • YC121.03.04

6-U2M8, Syndicate - Local tabloids in Syndicate and abroad in the Caldari State are clamoring over the rumored return of infamous I-RED pilot Katrina Oniseki - sometimes referred to among certain circles as the Iron Lady. Former I-RED Vice-Admiral Oniseki, founder of the sizable Oniseki Corporation (which itself owns entirely or partially a multitude of other corporations), has a long history for taking on heavy-handed approaches to solving problems. Moreover, she is most infamous for the “Syndicate Killing Fields” 15 scandal which largely pointed to her as the instigator and mastermind behind the gruesome acts.

The Syndicate Killing Fields scandal is reportedly what caused the retirement of Oniseki under the banner of her then freshly created Oniseki-Raata Internal Watch [O-RIW]. The scandal was also linked to the resignation of renown individual John Revenent of the Revenent Defense Corporation [RDC] from the position of Executor for I-RED. Since the fallout caused by the events, which I-RED at the time claimed to be the act of a rogue elite agent named Jaito Kruger, Oniseki has eluded paparazzi and stayed out of the spotlight. Keen observers of the whole affair liked to theorize that Oniseki retreated to the safety of her mountain fortress estate on the planet of Onitseru in New Caldari.

Now, years after the controversial chain of events, photos have surfaced of the Iron Lady out and about in the flesh. A leak reportedly from a low-lying staff member within I-RED claims that Oniseki has been observed touring within the XS-XAY Reppola Logistic Support. Curious onlookers and critics from outside I-RED have been quick to voice their thoughts on what these reported sightings spell for the future of the organization.

“It is too early to speculate if Miss Oniseki will return to a leadership position within I-RED”, commented one analyst for a Poitot tabloid. “A return to leadership will certainly cause I-RED critics to bombard the organization with questions and negativity, but of course given her infamous history it probably won’t be entirely unwarranted. We will just have to wait and see if any official announcements are made regarding her status.”

O-RIW maintains their security contract with I-RED. It, alongside RDC, are I-RED’s primary security contractors which are used to bolster its own in-house security forces of the Ishukone-Raata Security Corps [I-RSCO] and the Ishukone-Raata Enforcer Fleet [I-REF].

Celebrating two years, the Syndicate Splinterz League eagerly announces its biggest tournament yet…

Syndicate Splinterz League Celebrates Two Years, Announces Upcoming Tournament
Taigeru Beldeia • YC121.03.08

6-U2M8, Syndicate - Two years ago to this day, a handful of I-RED employees sought to create an official league to host Splinterz matches, a beloved sport in the Caldari State that sees custom-built robots duke it out in combat. Chairman for the SSL, Gerachi Boika, is currently hosting a gala aboard the Oriki Commercial Center in 6-U2M8. The event is sponsored by numerous big names which include I-RED, the Intaki Bank, and the Ishukone Corporation. Chairman Boika opened up the event with an announcement that the SSL will be hosting its biggest tournament to date, set to begin in June of YC121. The Syndicate Splinterz Superclash, as its going to be named, will be the league’s new major yearly tournament from this year going forward.

“I am pleased and humbled to bring this good news to the enthusiasts and audiences of Splinterz in Syndicate!”, announced Chairman Boika cheerfully. “SSL tournaments in the past will pale in comparison to the size of the Syndicate Splinterz Superclash both in terms of participant numbers and prizes. And for the latter, I on behalf of the entire SSL thank our generous sponsors of I-RED, Ishukone, Intaki Bank, Quafe, Aliastra, and many many more for their kind support.”

Ever since the return of I-RED to the 98Q “superpocket” years ago - an area consisting of the JQV5-9 and MK7-AO constellations - social researchers have observed a notable increase in the popularity of the traditionally State sport. While popularity for Splinterz remains the highest among populations dwelling in the aforementioned cluster of star systems, there is plenty traction gaining elsewhere in Syndicate. Particularly, the exciting visuals and displays of robotic combat seem to draw a lot of crowds and views from audiences all over the region. The ease with which gambling and bets can be made on matches has also likewise greatly helped increase the notoriety of the sport in the region of Syndicate, given the penchant for its residents to partake in such activities.

Applications for teams across the region to join the upcoming Summer tournament are now open. A full list of prizes have yet to be announced, but Chairman Boika did note that the grand prize will be one million Poitot Pounds. There are no entrance fees for the Syndicate Splinterz Superclash, courtesy of the array of big-name sponsors. A full list of tournament rules and qualifications will be released at a later date. For now, the Syndicate Splinterz League remains focused on advertising to recruit more interest in the battle royale sport.


An old partnership between I-RED and Khanid contractors folds up amid rising tensions between Khanid and Amarr groups…

I-RED Subsidiary Closes Its Doors After Failed Renewal Of Contract With Khanid
Jelvia Taredi • YC121.04.14

Khanid Prime - The Ishukone Khanid Logistics [I-KL] corporation has closed its doors and sold off its assets over the weekend following an announcement 1 posted by its CEO, Harin Shara Talor. Harin, a relative of I-RED capsuleer Creedance Talor, held a lead role in facilitating business relations between I-RED and the Khanid Kingdom. The corporation was in operation for roughly six years, until recent turmoil regarding the status of the Kingdom within the Empire has opted I-RED to not renew the contract for the continued existence of I-KL.

I-KL functioned as a multi-role company and included such services as: courier transportation, warehouse storage rentals, retail sales, and personnel distributions. While the company did not maintain a large presence among the capsuleer market, it operated in many systems and their respective local markets. Employees were notified over two weeks ago of the impending shutdown, and were offered a myriad of options following the closure of the corporation. Some employees opted to remain living in the Kingdom while others chose a relocation package which was subsidized by I-KL to move back to the Caldari State.

Non-personnel assets were either auctioned off in local markets or relocated under the umbrella of I-RED. A majority of assets, most notably transport ships and storage infrastructure, were redistributed to the command of I-RED.

When pressed for comment by local news agencies, Harin Talor did not provide anything other than a mention of the announcement posted on the Intergalactic Summit. Many economic analysts suspect that the recent rise in tensions between Khanid and Amarr groups are the reason to blame for the failure to renew the operational contract of I-KL. I-RED has shown a strong interest in providing public support to the Empire and its most notable capsuleer loyalists - groups such as PIE, LUMEN, and CVA. Analysts hypothesize that I-RED opted not to renew the contract in order to preserve relations with these groups. I-RED officials have yet to comment on the suspicions, and likely won’t.

In the meantime, Harin Talor has joined I-RED proper as a member, bringing with her a sizable portion of I-KL noncapsuleer employees.


A cultural phenomena makes itself readily apparent onboard I-RED facilities in Syndicate…

Thousands Celebrate 04.20 Across I-RED Syndicate Facilities With Music And Lots Of Harroule Dryweed
Taigeru Beldeia - YC121.04.20

6-U2M8, Syndicate - Across New Eden, the date of 04.20 is renown (or perhaps infamous) for users of the mentally stimulating crop Dryweed, originating from the Placid system of Harroule. While smoking Dryweed has relatively minimal effect on a user’s psyche compared to other forms of recreational drugs, the plant still carries with it some stigma in various corners of New Eden - most notably those areas under heavy Empire and State influence. Still, that did not stop reportedly “thousands” of residents across the many I-RED structures in Syndicate from openly celebrating their love for the unofficial holiday celebrating a very beloved plant.

“I do my work, I pay my taxes, and I contribute to society”, stated Arbash Jujaiko, a resident aboard the 6-U2M8 Oriki Commercial Center. “I’m just using today as an opportunity to share the love with my fellow mankind around me!”, he stated, as he offered a blunt to the I-RCN cameraman.

I-RED has no official stance on the usage of Harroule Dryweed among its residents in Syndicate. While use of recreational drugs aboard I-RED facilities in State territory are generally frowned upon, the facilities I-RED maintains in Syndicate are notoriously more relaxed about many types of social expectations. I-RCN reached out to Director of Public Works, Roirdan Bouchate, for comment on the matter.

“Well…”, started out Director Bouchate as he puffed out a cloud of smoke from what appeared to be a cigar which smelled awfully similar to Dryweed. “The general stance of I-RED on the subject of Dryweed use in particular is very…relaxed. So long as users do not disrupt the peace with their public gatherings and abide by local protocols such as smoking only in designated smoke areas, we allow our residents much leeway in celebrating or not celebrating four-twenty as they please.”

Meanwhile, keen market observers have noted a sharp spike in short-term profits for the Serpentis Corporation which coincide with today’s date.


With Summer still a while away, a notorious Syndicate fashion mogul attempts to gain an edge on the competition with early previews of his Summer catalog…

Fashion Mogul Rudy “Roo” Porteau Teases Early Previews Of Upcoming Summer Catalog
Taigeru Beldeia • YC121.04.26

Poitot, Syndicate - Syndicate based fashion designer Rudy Porteau has just teased a selection of shots for his upcoming Summer catalog, which will launch in early August. Porteau’s teaser was done on his Peeper™ account, and has already received thousands of likes and repeeps. The popularity of Porteau’s designs seems to remain high despite highly controversial claims 5 by rival fashion mogul Fabuleux in May of YC120. Porteau insists till this day that the claims Fabuleux made are false and malicious.

The early tease of upcoming releases for Porteau’s in-house brand, Roo’s Looks, comes weeks ahead of the Poitot Summer Fashion Show. Fashion commentators have noted that this early release could either set Roo’s Looks ahead of the other major fashion houses, or it could prove detrimental to the brand. Porteau seems willing to bank on the riskiness of the early tease, eager to stay ahead of the pack.

In another recent Peeper™ post by Porteau, an image of a model wearing a YC120 Summer outfit by Fabuleux is posed next to another image with the same model wearing a YC121 Summer outfit by Roo’s Looks. The post was captioned “Upgrade ur lewk this Summer! Soon, darlings!!!” followed by a kissing face emoticon. Comments are currently disabled for the post, but it has already garnered the attention of a large portion of Fabuleux fans, who have berated the post with vitriol and criticism.

The Summer of YC121 is set to be an interesting one for the fashion world, with rumors circulating of other fashion houses teasing their upcoming releases all in an attempt to remain in dominant positions.


Nadire Security Consultants Complete SSI-II Development Contract
Koren Akko - YC121.04.28

98Q-8O, Syndicate - It has been several months since the small Gallente security firm Nadire Security Consultants [NADSC] secured a secretive short term infrastructure development contract. Not much is known as to the goal or extent of the backroom deal, as executives and staff belonging to the Ishukone-Raata Accounting and Transport Corporation [I-RAT] have made an effort to withhold all information from the public, by citing security concerns.

Public records however have revealed that NADSC has been targeting Customs Offices in the SSI-II “Free Trade & Development Zone”. Which have been replaced under I-RAT, and what appears to be a shell corporation.

When further inquiries were made about these findings, a spokesperson for the Executor’s office Aimii Nata made a statement. “Ishukone-Raata is committed to the prosperity and fair trade practices within the SSI-II project zone. Contractors are sometimes utilized in an effort to aid in expansion operations against threats to stable free trade in the region, and more importantly to ensure Ishukone’s interests are secured.”

This is not new for Ishukone-Raata under the current directorship. Security issues have in the past been successfully outsourced to mercenary groups like Akagi, and now Nadire Security.


Semiki Based Contractor Breaks Ishukone-Raata Enforced NDA
Koren Akko - YC121.04.29

Semiki, The Forge - Following the successful purge of a aggressive malware infection last month, the more dire chapter of the Semiki Incident appears to be coming to a close. While sightings of Oniseki-Raata Internal Watch security vessels continue to be seen orbiting the Zainou station. It would seem that in light of the statements made by the Ishukone Watch that both ARC affiliates and the Ishukone-Raata “Cooperative” have already begun to remove unnecessary assets and personnel from the system.

The malware that was originally thought to be the product of a Lai Dai agent, continues to be researched by many loyalist organizations. ARC and their affiliates openly share carefully selected aspects of this research. A decision that has often drawn the ire of their politically aligned allies inside the Ishukone-Raata Enforcement Directive, who have kept all their findings under a blanket of confidentiality.

Officials however have recently report that a member of the Cooperative initiative has breached the Ishukone-Raata enforced NDA. The exact details of the leaked documents have yet to be released, if at all. An anonymous source who was unable to speak on the matter revealed that the individual involved was a employee of the Ishukone-Raata Technological Research Institute, by the name of Akihiko Hiko. They believed that members of the Internal Watch had uncovered incriminating evidence that Doctor Hiko had handed over sensitive documents to New Eden Correspondent Reporters and may have been planning on selling the same information to an unnamed individual affiliated with ARC.

The Executor’s Spokesperson, Aimii Nata was quick to release a statement that “all legal measures under the NDA agreement would be taken into consideration” and “the employee involved has taken it upon themselves to avoid custody, forcing our security to issue permits accepting the arrest of the implicated individual from outside sources”.

Local bounty offices have confirmed this by reporting a reward of 2,212,000,000.00 ISK has been placed for the capture and secure return of Ishukone-Raata property in the possession of Doctor Akihiko Hiko.


Gallente Holoseries ‘Game of Crowns’ Draws Criticism Abroad
Koren Akko - YC121.05.14

Atlanins, Everyshore - The Impetus production Game of Crowns first nine episodes were released on May 13th. Already it has seen major backlash from critics within religious circles of Amarrian Empire, and despite it’s overwhelming success, harsh comments from film groups inside the Federation. Many of them largely in part due to the depiction of the late Empress and an otherwise good story destroyed by to much “Sex & Violence”.

In an interview with holofilm critic Ucien Toire, he stated that in his opinion “Peeper is currently more ablaze then the scene during Elder’s Fall (A cut showing the single handed destruction of the Elder Fleet at the hands of the heroine styled Empress)” due to scenes involving Aimée Dreneau, where the actress playing the part of Jamyl is seen several times partaking in debauchery with prominent members of nobility and slaves. While others voiced frustration that Dochuta Karsoth, who is viewed as a ‘Good Guy’ in the series only trying to hunt down his good friend Doriam II’s assassins.

Unconfirmed reports also appear to point toward members of the Ardishapur family, who may have quietly joined in the rising anger inside the Empire due to the insinuation in the holoseries that their house was full of Purist Cultists who sought to forcefully take the Imperial Throne, but had been thwarted by a Federation spy and Imperial Advisor duo.

While Impetus has stated it’s production is “pure fiction”, tempers continue to flair and it seems the Game of Crowns may see itself removed from the Amarrian entertainment sector completely. This hasn’t seemed to phase the production team however, after releasing a teaser of the upcoming season that depicts the entry of King Khanid, Drifters and seemingly more adult orientated divisive scenes.


n light of a recent initiative from Khimi Harar, the I-RED Directorship has formally announced plans to participate in the economic activity of this newfound trade hub…

I-RED Announces Participation In LUMEN Ammatar Mandate Economic Initiative
Jelvia Taredi • YC121.05.24

Mehatoor, Devoid - In a press conference which just concluded, I-RED leadership members Alex Hinkelmann, Roirdan Bouchate, Valdezi Sun’khar, Julianni Avala, and Leela Naisto have formally announced the organization’s interest in contributing to the Ammatar Mandate Revitalization Project 1 spearheaded by Khimi Harar [LUMEN]. The proclamation comes after another announcement during the same press conference in which I-RED leadership members present revealed the fact that the organization will be temporarily engaging in faction warfare in support of long-time allies Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris [PIE]. Additionally, the temporary deployment reportedly also serves to train up new and returning veteran capsuleers in I-RED.

“I-RED will plan to set up buy orders for various commodities in the Tebu Amkhiman Fortizar which we hope will add to the appeal of locals and passerby utilizing the facility’s market services”, stated Executor Hinkelmann. “We are both humbled and excited by this grand opportunity to contribute to the economic prosperity of the region led by our faithful allies in LUMEN. We hope this will one small step forward in the continued strengthening of our ties with our Amarr colleagues and friends.”

When the directorship panel was asked questions on the establishment of offices from I-RED’s various subsidiaries in the Tebu Amkhiman Fortizar, Director Bouchate replied with the following:

“At the moment we are not yet ready to announce the installation of any offices, warehouses, or industrial plants from any I-RED subsidiary in the Fortizar. The I-RED Board of CEOs is currently in talks about the possibilities of basing some operations out of the facility. Namely, Integrated Health Systems and Myoka Galactic are brought up as potential candidates to make use of various leased spaces available in the Citadel.”

Meanwhile, for the past few days there have been numerous sightings of transport vessels registered under I-RED traveling between The Forge and Devoid. Presumably, these reports can be taken as a sign that I-RED is speeding up preparation for their deployment into the area, which is expected to last about a month.


Ishukone-Raata Security Contractors to Conduct Joint-Protectorate Exercise
Koren Akko - YC121.05.24

Mehatoor, Devoid - Ishukone-Raata’s largest security firm RDC released a short statement alongside Spokesperson, Aimii Nata, that assets and personnel had already been deployed to the Devoid region. For what they identified as a joint training exercise between the State Protectorate, RDC, and elements within the 24th Imperial Crusade.

The extent of the exercise has yet to be released and may likely remain that way due to cited operational security policy.


A madman assumed under the influence of various illegal boosters takes an entire electronics store hostage within the 6-U2M8 Oriki Commercial Center’s famous megamall, The Concourse.

BREAKING NEWS: Intense Hostage Situation Comes To A Close Aboard 6-U2M8 Oriki Commercial Center
Selenna Solange • YC121.05.25

6-U2M8, Syndicate - Approximately six hours ago, a young man entered the TekShak™ electronics retail store located on the 31st floor of The Concourse, a sprawling supermassive mall located in the heart of the 6-U2M8 Oriki Commercial Center. The man, identified as 33-year-old Syndicate native Sacha Aloumeart, then pulled out concealed weapons from his trenchcoat and fired a flurry of warning shots into the ceiling. He blocked all the exits with small explosive devices in case any of the customers inside tried to escape, and corralled the guests inside into the center of the store. Special Operations And Tactics (SOAP) forces shut down and evacuated The Concourse within an hour, and established a perimeter around the besieged TekShak™ store. Only thirty minutes ago has the hostage situation ended with no loss of life, and Sacha Aloumeart in custody.

Many details about the incident have yet to be announced by Oriki Commercial Center Chief Of Security Nagato Minskalo. What has been confirmed, however, is the fact that Aloumeart was under the influence of “various illegal and deeply mind altering boosters.” What is not clear is how Aloumeart managed to sneak in two semi-automatic weapons into The Concourse grounds without alerting the security system. Chief Minskalo has urged local news agencies to avoid the spread of rumors around this mystery, particularly that Aloumeart may have had an accomplice help him smuggle in the weapons.

Aloumeart managed to hold 57 people hostage within the TekShak™ store. I-RCN has managed to obtain various reports from those who witnessed the incident unfold. Apparently Aloumeart was acting distraught as he made his way to the TekShak™, mumbling to himself the entire time and looking on edge. As he began his siege on the store, witnesses outside reported hearing him yell about how “Triglavians are real!”, and “They are coming for us!” Upon gathering all the hostages together and binding their limbs with tape, Aloumeart proceeded to line the group with a plethora of audio devices set to various media broadcasts. He was apparently shouting “they are all lying to you, I know the truth and they [Triglavians] are coming for us all!”

After attempting to broker a peace for roughly six hours, SOAP forces finally had enough and sent in a stealth drone through the TekShak™’s air vent system after finally gaining access to it. The drone then fired stunning projectile at Aloumeart followed by launching a focused stasis webification grenade. SOAP squad members outside the store then bursted in and subdued the erratic Aloumeart before any harm could be done to the hostages he was “preaching” to.

Aloumeart did sustain numerous bruises and fractures due to the force with which SOAP teams handled the suspect. He is being treated for his injuries in a highly secure cell located within Kovonen Hospital aboard the 617I-I Tuulinen Observatory. He is reportedly under the custody of I-RED’s Internal Watch, an advanced security force provided by their contract with Oniseki-Raata Internal Watch [O-RIW]. Internal Watch is expected to interrogate him once he is deemed medically clear from the mind altering substances present in his system.

Meanwhile, hostages from the incident are being treated within local hospitals aboard the Oriki Commercial Center. A formal statement regarding the incident from the I-RED Directorship has been released just moments ago:

"The hostage situation aboard the Oriki Commercial Center has concluded with no loss of life thanks to the valiant and strategic decision making of the facility’s SOAP team. We are extremely fortunate the outcome of this frightening experience has been a relatively good one. The Concourse will remain closed for the next twelve hours while local security forces survey the grounds and gather evidence - we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. The safety of our employees, residents, guests, and visitors is paramount. We will ensure everything in our power that an incident such as this never happens again.

Meanwhile, we would like to urge calm regarding the outrageous claims this man made during the whole affair. While the Triglavian Collective is one of numerous emergent threats that have sprouted in recent times, their presence has been contained in the Abyss realm which they inhabit. They are mysterious and rather poorly understood. The claims by this deranged man have no substance."


Leader of the Tears of Reschard, an Intaki extremist organization, has reached out to I-RCN and various other news agencies across the cluster with a message to deliver following their attack on the Khanid Kingdom less than ten hours ago…

BREAKING NEWS: Intaki Extremists Launch Widespread Attack Against Targets In Seevadin Constellation
Jelvia Taredi • YC121.06.03

Amarr, Domain - An Intaki extremist organization named Tears of Reschard has recently launched a mass-scale attack against numerous planetary and station targets in the Khanid Kingdom. I-RCN is currently working to verify the results of these attacks, and in the meantime looks to ACN for more insight. Leader of the Tears of Reschard, Rhey Aziah, has reached out to I-RCN and various other capsuleer and non-capsuleer news agencies with a message. While normally I-RCN would not publish ramblings from such extremists, we feel it necessary to relay this important information to the greater galactic community. A transcript of their message is as follows:

The attacks in the Khanid Kingdom
From: Rhey Aziah
Sent: 2019.06.03 06:54
To: Alton Haveri, Cyrillian Voth, Elinari Rhodan, Hoovand Lindus, Jelvia Taredi, Lina Ambre, Ret Gloriaxx, Selenna ‘Scarlet’ Solange, Taora Teonsur, Zara Serir,

Hello.

My name is Rhey Aziah, leader of the Tears of Reschard.

Today, my corporation has successfully launched a widespread attack against terrestrial planets and stations in the Seevadin constellation of the Khanid Kingdom. Before word breaks out about these attacks and you all get to work conjuring all sorts of lovely media, I wanted to make a few things clear:

The Intaki Assembly did not sponsor or condone this attack; they did not even know about it

The planning of this strike has taken several months, during which time we paid lobbyists to pester the Intaki Assembly and Gallente Federation Senate about this issue - in both cases the efforts have been met with “we’re working on it” with no tangible results or completely ignored

The drastic scope of these attacks is symbolic; lives have been lost and will be lost in the ensuing days to represent all the past lives Idama en Waro has lived and died; unfortunately, more peaceful routes have proven unsuccessful in retrieving Idama en Waro from Sa-Baron Kufail’s clutches, so a strong message must be sent

Make no mistake as to who to lay fault on for these attacks and all the lost lives; the blood spilled is on the hands of none other than Sa-Baron Atazil Kufail; to a lesser extent, it is also on the hands of incompetent leadership from the Intaki Assembly, Gallente Federation Senate, and the Court Chamberlain.

So there you go. Have at it. Call us extremists if you wish. Call us terrorists. Whatever. Just know that doing the right thing it is impossible to label doing the right thing as anything but doing the right thing.

Justice will continue to pour from the dark skies until the cruel and greedy Sa-Baron Kufail relinquishes control of Idama en Waro over to the Intaki Ida monasteries.

Pratya yavati,
Rhey

In the meantime, I-RCN extends our greatest sympathies for all those who are affected by these attacks. We will continue updating on the situation as more information becomes available.


PUBLIC RELEASE: Ishukone-Raata’s Julianni Avala Temporarily Relieved of Diplomatic Post
Koren Akko - YC121.06.20

Malkalen, Lonetrek - Members of Julianni Avala’s diplomatic team released a notice shortly after a meeting between several members of Ishukone-Raata’s Directorship in Malkalen. Stating “effective immediately Director Avala would be resigning her duties in regards to Ishukone-Raata’s Public Affairs Department.”

 Director Julianni Avala

Individuals involved in the decision have said that the once popular face of the organization had long planned on taking a leave of absence that would likely continue to interfere with her expected duties abroad. As expected with this key position vacant the board was quick to appoint a temporary liaison, a woman by the name of Nittara Ozanen.

2115363676_256 Temporary Public Relations Liaison Nittara Ozanen

The choice of Ozanen has however brought Executor Hinkelmann’s wisdom into question, especially with the Intaki Prosperity Initiative and LUMEN re-negotiation deadline closing in. It isn’t apparent whether Avala’s replacement will be up to the task in what is looking to be one of the most difficult diplomatic endeavors in recent I-RED history.


Despite the recent surge of incursions from Drifter forces against capsuleer-controlled null sec systems, I-RED formally unveils XS-XAY as its capital system in the 98Q “superpocket” of Syndicate…

I-RED Designates XS-XAY As Official Headquarters For Syndicate Operations
Selenna Solange • YC121.06.28

XS-XAY, Syndicate - While I-RED has long maintained significant operations in the XS-XAY system, situated near the entry into the 98Q superpocket, a collection of 17 star systems, earlier this week the organization made it officially recognized as its primary base of operations in the region. This formal announcement was tied with the successful deployment of a Fortizar-class Citadel in static orbit over the serene world of XS-XAY IV. The announcement was made by I-RED Executor Alex Hinkelmann at the christening ceremony for the now operational Fortizar, dubbed the Gariushi Business Center.

“We welcome the newest and most impressive addition to I-RED’s Operation Grey Steel project”, stated Executor Hinkelmann with elation. “It is our hope that this new facility will serve as an important hub for trade, business, diplomacy, and cultural exchange to take place. Entities not overtly hostile or threatening to I-RED and our allies will be granted access to the structure and its facilities. In the meantime, our Public Works department is steady at work fleshing out internal design plans. There will be adequate space for businesses to lease, and we look forward to forging new partnerships with local and foreign companies.”

When pressed about the possible threat that Drifters pose against capsuleer assets, Executor Hinkelmann only had this to say, “I-RED stands ready to protect our assets against the Drifter menace, and we will not fail.”

Residential properties are quickly being filled by immigrants from other structures in the region, as well as from colonies in the adjacent regions. Census data reveals a peculiar observation - a large portion of immigrants from nearby regions happen to originate from colonies in Solitude. What this says about the status of colonies in Solitude is debatable, but I-RED welcomes them with open arms. Meanwhile, residential contractors and housing development companies have been clamoring over a bidding process which will see a select few of them offered an opportunity to develop more housing properties in the Fortizar. Similarly, commercial development firms are eager to gain access and start constructing offices and warehouses businesses will be able to lease from.

I-RED has yet to appoint a station manager for its flagship facility, but it is expected one will be appointed within the coming weeks. Rumors among various Syndicate tabloids suggest that the position is being considered for a number of highly qualified candidates, including a former station governor of the Intaki Space Police station in IIRH-G just a couple star systems away. Another possible candidate is a renown and retired colonial administrator for the Intaki colony of Duureanta 1, otherwise known as Harroule IV. A final candidate comes in the form of a high-ranking commander for I-RED’s in-house naval division, the Ishukone-Raata Enforcer Fleet.

For the time being, I-RED’s leadership infrastructure will continue to operate out of the Reppola Logistic Support facility in the same system. It is not expected the famed “Directorship Sector”, the administration hub which houses the heads of the various I-RED departments along with their most valued staff, will not be transferred into the Fortizar anytime soon. Executor Hinkelmann did not comment on whether or not the I-RED admin hub will relocate to the Fortizar, citing that is classified information.


BREAKING NEWS: Ishukone-Raata’s Internal Watch Expands Deployment on Intaki Homeworld
Koren Akko - YC121.08.20

Intaki, Placid - Shortly after O-RIW’s Cmdr. Shiran Mazaki publicly reported Ishuk-Raata’s assault on the pirate held customs office in orbit of the Intaki Homeworld, orders were almost immediately issued to several hundred ground based troops. These orders appear to have caused Ishuk-Raata’s Joint Contracting Force [JCF] to reposition, to locations viewed as strategic positions well within range of the megacorporation Lai Dai positions and most of the Ishukone operated facilities.

It is unknown at this time if the mobilized Directive forces have been in contact with the Intaki Assembly or their militia. But civilians say they have seen O-RIW deploy anti-orbital entry platforms that would normally see use against space-to-ground shuttles or transport craft, and so far local authorities been told that all their forces have been given a strict observation order in regards to all the groups involved planetside. Even toward viewed illegal Lai Dai activities.

Along with these movements the media at large has been removed from Ishuk-Raata’s subsidiary extraction facility known as ‘E-5 Kirvaat’ located in the north. Though dozens of dropships and transport craft continue flights in and out of the facility, while heavily armed security perimeters continue to expand outward to a distance of one kilometer.

I-RCN remains committed in updating this story as it progresses. If you have more information on the Intaki Affair, please contact a member of our team so the cluster may hear your story.


OPINION PIECE: Project Solace - Loyalists or Independants?
Koren Akko - YC121.08.24

Kulelen, The Citadel - Displays flicker with news of the constant Triglavian assaults on trade-lanes within the Caldari State. Causing destruction, chaos, and fear among millions of citizens. Though among all this uncertainty, organizations continue to provide a sense of hope. The affiliates within the Consortium come to mind as they spearhead the clusters research effort into the Triglavian threat, but it looks as if they’re not alone in these efforts. Among other empyrean entities we see more factions willing to stem the wake of destruction brought forth by the Collective.

After speaking to a now independent team of researchers who had just arrived from the Ishuk-Raata jump freighter, Sohei. Once employees of the Enforcement Directive’s research corporation known as the Ishukone-Raata Technological Research Institute [I-RTI], they spoke mostly of putting what they’ve learned to use where it mattered most.

“My colleagues and I have learned all we can under the Pikovaru Project, and it’s time we put those long hours to use and move to another project that’s willing to do something now.”

Many within loyalist circles have similarly voiced their discontent with the flow, and advancements of their research. Feeling that they might be held back, or that leaders lack the courage to release their findings. Though that seems to be changing with the recent announcement, like these researchers many more appear to be setting off to join their peers in Project Solace.

The project itself appears to be in it’s infancy, as the announcement establishes their need to work with others in an attempt to develop a new way of dealing with the Collective threat.

“A permanent solution must be created. I am looking for those who study in the following fields to step forward and volunteer. Equipment, assets and ISK needed will be provided. I simply need those with the Time and Expertise. A Station will be Commissioned specifically for this venture.”

While this project is still learning to stand it seems that has done little to hinder those looking to make their difference in this conflict. It is suspected that many others will follow in the footsteps of researchers like these and heed new calls wherever that may be. With this comes another fear, one that will further put control into the hands of independants, and outside of loyalist purview.

Will this be enough to defeat the threats we all face today? We’ll have to wait and see.

Koren Akko - YC121.09.01

XS-XAY, Syndicate - Many corporations and their workers have already begun their preparations for one of the few official holidays within the Caldari State. Like these corporations, Ishukone-Raata has also begun preparing, however with this years official announcement of celebrations came a slight change from previous held festivities.

CHTAR Secures Intaki Homeworld Customs Contract
Koren Akko - 121.10.06

Intaki, Placid - Last week seen the closure of a contractual bid for the customs office in orbit of the Intaki homeworld in Placid. The bid began with two corporations, the Nadire Security Consultants [NADSC], and Diaspora member Chatelain Auxiliary Response [CHTAR], but ended on a less competitive note. With NADSC opting to work alongside the Diaspora signatory.

Ishukone-Raata’s Public Relations Liaison, Nittara Ozanen, who brokered the agreement stated “with the Enforcement Directives involvement in militia activities, the state of occupancy of the system, and our commitment to remain neutral in all Assembly planetside affairs. We seen it necessary to facilitate a contract to a party that can, and will be capable of operating under our long standing free-trade policies.”

The contract has been said to place full operational control of the orbital facility under the purview of the Intaki Diaspora member CHTAR, with NADSC sub-contractors aiding in various civilian departments. With several enforcement requirements, such as a 0% tax rate for all non-black listed organizations, along with compliance of any Ishukone Corporation standards.

Currently the Customs Office refuses access to a very limited list, including the Lai Dai Megacorporation, who remains at the center of the series of incidents in the area.


I-RED Adjusts Public Policy - Issues Warning in Wake of Escalation
Koren Akko - 121.11.26

Malkalen, Lonetrek - The announcement came earlier today from the Office of the Enforcement’s Board of Directors that a change to public policy was implemented at 03:44 hours. With the continued Triglavian escalation against the citizens of the Caldari State, and their attempts to sway capsuleer entities to their cause. That effective immediately all entities, independent or loyalist aiding the invading forces would be seen as enemies to the Caldari State, and Ishukone in the eyes of the Enforcement Directive.

“Any individual, or entity found aiding in the assault against the navies, colonies, or citizens within the borders of the [Caldari] State will be seen as an enemy. Incurring a immediate reduction of standings and blacklist for future market opportunities.” stated Internal Watch Commander Mazaki during the press briefing.

It was implied that these consequences may be applied not only to organizations as a whole if they refuse to attempt to cease their employees participation against lawful entities, but also investors and shareholders.

It’s been reported by the Public Relations Department, that already these changes have brought one organization and eight individuals to a negative standing from a allied status. It’s unclear how many more will refuse the call of CONCORD and their homelands, but it is clear, Ishukone-Raata has joined the chorus of other capsuleers in urging their allies to think before they act.


Ishukone-Raata to Enter Minmatar-Treaty Conflict
Koren Akko - 121.11.28

Mehatoor, Devoid - Left over assets from May’s joint-exercise may begin to see active use. As officials affirmed their support alongside their Amarrian counterparts. Calling for the removal of the Minmatar-led treaty, that has seen the handover of sovereign systems by rebellious entities within the 24th Imperial Crusade.

Details into the extent of the deployment have been restricted for operational reasons. Though questions have been raised as to the position of Ishuk-Raata in regards to the controversial demands from Lord Sarum and the Floseswin system.

Nittara Ozanen only stated that “Ishuk-Raata will not be involved in any ground based activity and the matter of Floseswin is outside our operational scope.”

So far there has been no official signal as to when forces will see combat in this campaign, but reports have come in that eight Ishuk-Raata marked Charon-class freighters have been spotted within the last few hours heading to the Devoid region.

Ishukone-Raata Contracts Under Fire
Koren Akko - 122.01.12

Tanoo, Derelik - The Oniseki-Raata Internal Watch is under scrutiny just days after the destruction of a stolen transport vessel attempting to flee the Solace Astrahaus in Tanoo. The Internal Watch Agent in charge of the security contract, Shiran Mazaki; has insisted that his actions were justified and legal.

It’s unclear exactly how many lives were lost during the theft or why the pilot stole the craft. However many within Khimi Harar have claimed the occupants were attempting to flee a quiet quarantine. These claims have been met with denial by Project Solace managers, and silence by their Oniseki-Raata Contractors.

Leadership within the Ishukone-Raata Directorship Board have been unavailable to comment. The only statement released on the issue was from Liaison Ozanen: “The contract oversight is in the hands of the Internal Watch. But under Enforcement Directive regulatory rules they will be kept to the highest standards. We will be investigating Commander Mazaki’s role in this unfortunate incident, and ensuring the privacy of their employers.”

It appears that as of now the contract will continue to be conducted by the Internal Watch as vessels have been seen in orbit of the Solace Astrahaus. Though it remains to be seen if diplomatic pressure from allies will be enough to force the Directorship to act against a legally binding contract.

Annual Commerce Planning Panel Announced
Koren Akko - 122.03.30



Tanoo, Derelik - Not far from Tebu Amkhiman sits the proposed site of the Enforcement Directive’s first planned development in the Derelik region. The structure still has some hurdles to tear down before it begins it’s deployment. Members of the Foreign Market Development Board [FMDB] have stated that this is partly due to the continued issues surrounding the months long standings renewal, which has been described as unwarranted by some.

Investors have already begun to question Ishukone-Raata’s ability to re-enter the Amarrian markets after the failed subsidiary contract renewal with the Khanid Kingdom, and continued diplomatic issues with loyalist entities. In a bid to remove doubts and regain confidence in the foreign markets, the Ishukone-Raata Corporate Investment Bank [I-RCB] partnered with Ishukone-Raata Industrial Partnership [I-RIP] have committed to hosting the annual Commerce Planning Panel in Tanoo.

The spokesperson for the Market Development Board released a date and location for the CPPanel. While they’re still working on securing a venue aboard Tebu Amkhiman, they feel no changes should be expected in regards to the locale. The date issued to prospective investors or interested parties has been set for YC122 April 19th - 122.04.19, at 00:00 NEST.

Grey Steel Investments Changes Inbound
Koren Akko - 122.08.16



XS-XAY, Syndicate - Recently shareholders have begun to publicly voice concern over their structural investments under Ishukone-Raata’s Operation Grey Steel. Citing a lack of response to inquiries, and dividend payouts for at least several months. While one of the longest public Empyrean investment opportunities located within the Intaki Syndicate, the endeavor has shown a level of disorder since the resignation of Roirdan Bouchate, and Julianni Avala.

Members directly involved with the oversight of the project have stated changes are inbound saying “For over five years, with the help of our valued investors. Operation Grey Steel was able to launch various infrastructural, and financial needs to several neglected constellations of space. We remain committed to see our investments through, however changes to the operation are in motion.”

While stating further details will be released to Grey Steel investors first, leaked documents show a certain willingness to outsource management personnel to outsiders, along with a possible rebrand relating to the reformed SynCo group.

Official Press Release from former I-RED executive Roirdan Bouchate
Taigeru Beldeia • YC123.03.20

Duureanta, Harroule, Placid - In a lengthy formal response by Roirdan Bouchate disseminated amongst local fluid router networks, Bouchate rebukes what he describes as false allegations from a recent news release from The Placid Tribune 3. While he did admit for the first time in recent history that his partner, also a former I-RED executive Selenna ‘Scarlet’ Solange, and he did welcome a child in the last couple months, he reprimanded The Placid Tribune staff for posting older paparazzi photos of him vacationing on Duureanta.

“The photos mentioned by The Placid Tribune are more than two weeks old, yet they decide to air the headline now when the Viriette constellation is under siege by Nation forces”, stated Bouchate. “To think that a rather reputable news agency such as The Placid Tribune would let an error like this slip past their editorial staff is rather disheartening. The reality is that in recent days, I have returned to interstellar affairs temporarily to assist local forces in Harroule with evacuations of interstellar civilian installations, as necessary. I am proud to report that already we have succeeded in evacuating more than 34,000 civilians from various installations. Moreover, I am proud of the fortitude of my employer, I-RED, for lending me resources to accomplish these tasks.”

I-RCN was able to verify Bouchate’s statements. An official I-RED addendum as added shortly after the initial launch of the press release to state that I-RED was providing transports on loan to local Viriette political entities for the evacuation of civilian installations in space. Security services are also being provided free of charge for local governments that wish to use them, although for now they are limited to escort duties for evacuation operations.

A storm of negative comments were levied against Bouchate almost immediately following the release of The Placid Tribune’s piece, which is likely the reason for the swift official press statement from Bouchate himself. The negative commentary was mostly relegated to hyperactive media groups from Federation communities bordering Placid.

“While I identify mostly with the Intaki Syndicate, the people of Harroule will always be my people”, Bouchate added. “I will never abandon them in times of need. Let alone vacation while innocents in space are under threat from Nation incursions.”

I-RED Post-Incursion Economic Initiative Rolls Out In Full Force
Selenna Solange • YC123.03.27

Harroule, Placid - Following the cessation of a Nation incursion into Viriette, the I-RED Board of Directors has gone forward with pushing an economic stimulus initiative for the constellation. It is likely that the planning stage of the operation was conceived in the middle of the incursion timeframe. I-RED has based its operations out of the Harroule system using an Astrahus-class citadel.

“The Viriette constellation is home to many Intaki colonies”, stated I-RED Executor Alex Hinkelmann. “I-RED has a longstanding relationship with the Intaki people, and following the most recent Nation incursion our hearts go out to those who may have lost loved ones aboard the outlying civilian space installations. We stand resolute alongside our Intaki friends, and look forward to conducting economic repair operations for the area.”

Critics from adjacent Federation territories, namely Hawks from non-Intaki colonies, have blasted the I-RED operation as a thinly veiled guise for asserting Caldari State influence in the area following the socioeconomic impact of the Nation incursion. Especially since I-RED has chosen to temporarily join in faction warfare for the duration of the economic initiative.

I-RED officials have dismissed those claims as “irrelevant, and poorly misunderstood accusations.”

“I-RED’s scope of operations for the time being include: anti-piracy patrols, distribution of construction equipment/food/medical supplies, and seeding of the local market with various trade goods”, stated Executor Hinkelmann. “Now, as always, I-RED remains committed to protecting our relationship with the Intaki people. Discussions are underway with local colonial officials on how we can best render any assistance, if desired.”

Sarum Vassal Topples Rival House in Bid for Influence
Jelvia Taredi • YC123.04.01

Mekhios, Sarum Prime, Domain - In Empire culture, minor holders and vassals to the major Houses engage in a perpetual socioeconomic (and sometimes military) battle for influence. A long-time vassal to the Sarum House, Lady Abigail Renaud, has successfully subdued the most prominent rival to her family’s estate, House Baelor. The move is suspected to bring substantial favor and influence for House Renaud.

Inside sources report to I-RCN that House Baelor was burdened with debt and struggling with a potential bankruptcy situation due to neglecting financial responsibility in favor of expanding infrastructure within their holdings. By taking out loans to support this infrastructure development, they likely exceeded their ability to pay it back. These sources suspect that this lack of balance has left the House Baelor susceptible to power moves by rival houses. The most immediate threat to the influence of House Baelor being that of House Renaud.

As for House Renaud, the heads of the family have within recent years fallen out of prominence. Empire political analysts theorize this may have been due to a lack of strong leadership within the ruling family. However, Lady Abigail Renaud, who is also a capsuleer, has been reportedly eager to improve the standings of her family’s holdings. It is rumored that under the advisement of Lady Abigail Renaud, House Renaud moved in to purchase major territorial assets from House Baelor in order for House Baelor to better manage their financial issues.

The holdings for House Renaud has now effectively doubled thanks to the acquisitions from House Baelor, while House Baelor has all but dissipated as a result of mismanagement of their assets. How Lady Abigail Renaud plans to utilize House Renaud’s newfound influence on Mekhios remains to be seen.

Tense Standoff Between I-RED and UNF Forces Leaked; UNF Orbital Shipyard Continues Expansion
Taigeru Beldeia • YC123.03.31

Eugales, Placid - In footage leaked to local fluid route networks by an unknown witness, a lone I-RED Harpy-class assault frigate can be seen examining the UNF orbital shipyard in orbit of Eugales VI, a storm world in outer orbit within the star system. UNF pilots that were active at the time of the encounter then proceeded to undock in two vessels, and engaged in an orbit around the orbital shipyard. A minute or so of the tense encounter ensues, before the I-RED vessel is seen warping off.

I-RED has not officially published any details regarding the incident. Military analysts are unsurprised of the encounter, given that I-RED has recently engaged in an economic stimulus initiative of the neighboring Viriette constellation following a recent Sansha’s Nation incursion. Given the close proximity of UNF’s base of operations in Eugales to Viriette, an encounter was expected to happen at some point.

Meanwhile, I-RCN has verified reports that the UNF orbital shipyard has seen an increased output of combat vessels. The marked increase in production of these warships coincides with the recent deployment of Federal Intelligence Office taskforce to the system to allegedly “carry out counterterrorism operations.” Furthermore, additional extra-large construction apparatuses have been observed being added to the shipyards.

Again, when pressed for comment on the situation in a recent press briefing, I-RED Executor Alex Hinkelmann declined to share any details on I-RED’s stance towards the UNF operations in Eugales. He only stated, “operations of the UNF in Eugales are of no concern or priority to the Ishuk-Raata Enforcement Directive. Clearly, however, the Federation government may have some issues to discuss with them.”

Cooperation With Local Elements Turns Sour for Intaki Space Police
Selenna Solange • YC123.04.03

Ishukone Corporation Factory, 98Q-8O, Syndicate - Sources within the Intaki Business Logistics Union [I-BLU] have revealed a disturbing trend of leaked confidential information from ISP data vaults within the JQV5-9 constellation.

An anonymous I-BLU non-capsuleer employee has submitted reports to I-RCN that their capsuleer employer was involved in covert ‘clean up’ operations to retrieve ISP data stolen by a local pirate gang. I-RCN has been unable to substantiate the claims of this baseliner employee, however, if true, then the news is likely to damage local business confidence in the ISP. The nature of the data that was supposedly hacked is suspected to relate to security contracts ISP has taken up recently with local businesses who hire out security escorts.

Such confidential data is normally heavily encrypted in local data terminals maintained by the ISP, and the theft of such data may indicate that the local ISP branches have been infiltrated by pirate elements. I-RCN has not received any comments from the ISP despite reaching out for more information. Likewise, I-BLU leadership was unavailable for comment with regards to the potential leak from within their organization.

Khimi Harar Allegedly to Deploy Assets to Placid to Assist Long-Time Ally I-RED
Jelvia Taredi • YC123.04.06

Mehatoor, Devoid - With the Amarr militia gaining a substantial foothold over the CEWPA warzone, Khimi Harar [LUMEN] is poised to begin deploying assets and affiliated elsewhere in the cluster. Military experts are hypothesizing that LUMEN and certain affiliates will deploy to Placid in efforts to assist their long-time allies of I-RED in the Caldari-Gallente warzones. LUMEN has yet to make an official announcement on the matter, however.

Amarrian militia forces have steadily been asserting a dominant level of control in the Amarr-Minmatar warzone systems for some time now. While LUMEN has erected support facilities in Syndicate in the recent past to support efforts of I-RED and I-BLU, their primary focus remained on dealing with opportunities and issues in the Empire, Kingdom, and Mandate. However, recent events suggest that they intend to redeploy key forces to Placid in an effort to convey their gratitude to I-RED and the State for their assistance to the Empire through the Triglavian War and Blood Raider conflicts in the Mandate.

I-RED, among other State militia forces, have successfully flipped control of the systems of Harroule, Brarel, and Intaki from Federal militia forces. The operations on I-RED’s part are components of an aggressive economic stimulus initiative following a recent Sansha’s Nation incursion into the constellation of Viriette. If LUMEN and affiliates do end up deploying to Placid, it is expected that they will bring with them a number of supplies to support humanitarian and financial operations.

Myoka Galactic Adopts New Signature Colors and Unveils New Hovercar Model
Taigeru Beldeia • YC123.04.08

Navyii Akat, Intaki, Placid - In a press release and special showcase that took place in the Intaki capital of Navyii Akat, I-RED subsidiary carmaker Myoka Galactic unveiled a new sports hovercar model in two new signature colors - Prussian Blue and Flaxen Gold. The introduction of two new signature colors follows nearly a year after the formation of the Intaki-Business Logistics Union [I-BLU], a related but separate organization of I-RED.

Myoka Galactic, originally a small specialist hovercar maker based in Placid, paraded the new sports hovercar as a melding of luxury and the Intaki value of simplicity. The new model, dubbed Essentia, is a blend of modern minimalism combined with classic throwbacks to the first hovercars ever produced. The end result produces a “fusion of old and new, of complex yet sustainable, of luxury and simplicity” as stated by Myoka Galactic executives.

The new signature colors of Prussian Blue and Flaxen Gold join the traditional Myoka Galactic signature colors of Gunmetal Grey, Ruby Red, and Royal Gold. All of the aforementioned colors are offered in either metallic or matte finishes. Sales for the new Essentia hovercar began during the public showcase, and at the conclusion of the day Myoka Galactic stated that all orders for the first year of production have been fulfilled.

Continued Unrest Among Multiple Worlds as Billions Remain Trapped in Pochven
Koren Akko • YC123.04.09

Malkalen, Lonetrek - Despite crackdown efforts by megacorporate security forces, there are numerous outbreaks daily across various planets and interstellar facilities regarding status of countless State citizens still trapped in Pochven. No megacorporation has been immune to these outbreaks of protest, and the various blocs have taken different approaches to handle the matter. The CEP, much to the chagrin of citizens across the State, has remained relatively quiet on the matter.

“My family has been left to die at the hands of Triglavians, and the State does nothing”, professed Ani Kusov, a machinist working for the Corporate Police Force. “I feel abandoned by the leaders we are told to abide by - to believe in. The State is failing me. It is failing us.”

EDENCOM leadership and leading scientists have yet to be able to safely study the effects of the supposed “bioadaptation” taking place across the various worlds in Pochven. It is unclear whether this process is proving fatal to the populations that remain in Pochven.

Caldari citizens across the State are still reeling from the devastating losses inflicted by the Triglavian invasions of YC122, and the dismal performance of what they believed was one of the strongest militaries in the known universe. Rumors are abound that the State Armed Forces are undergoing a deep reorganization strategy, which includes a complete tactical strategy overhaul of weapons systems. I-RCN has been unable to verify the veracity of such rumors, but following the Triglavian invasions both I-RED and Ishukone military subsidiaries have seen a notable uptick in contracts for hybrid weapon systems. Similarly, Ishukone turreted vessel manufacturers have been struggling to keep up with the demand for such vessels in the wake of the Triglavian invasions.

I-RCN will continue to monitor the ever-changing sociopolitical atmosphere in the State to bring you the latest updates.

Khimi Harar Destroys Kybernaut Azbel in Joint Operation With Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris
Empire Associates, edited by Jelvia Taredi • YC123.04.16

Parses, Khanid - After a week-long operation in the Fekhoya constellation within Khanid Kingdom space, Khimi Harar [LUMEN] and The Excubitoris Chapter [PIE] successfully destroyed an Azbel owned by the Triglavian-loyal Kybernaut alliance ‘Assimilation of everything Triglavian’ [INVAS] in the system of Parses in a joint operation.

“Never forget, Never forgive.” was the loyalists’ rallying cry throughout the operation, a reference to the destruction wrought by Triglavian forces during the Invasions, conflicts which ultimately resulted in the Empire’s loss of the systems Niarja and Raravoss, among others, to the Collective. A statement issued by LUMEN described the endeavour as a “reaffirmation of Holy Amarr’s sovereignty over its territory” as well as a “message to other Triglavian sympathisers that they are not welcome within Imperial space”. The statement also went on to recognise the “appreciated cooperation and support” of PIE during several stages of the operation. A similar PIE statement thanked LUMEN for their ongoing support in removing traitors and heretics from Amarr.

PIE’s Khanid expedition located the initial target and both groups worked together to destroy it, with LUMEN providing the majority of the strike forces. It remains unclear whether the destruction of the INVAS Azbel in Parses was a standalone campaign, or whether it simply marks the beginning of a broader initiative.

LUMEN has not yet offered to comment on this particular matter, however the operation has made it clear that the traditionally defensive-minded organisation does possess a willingness to launch significant pre-emptive strikes against hostile entities in Empire and Kingdom space when deemed necessary for defense and security. The Excubitoris Chapter merely reaffirms it’s commitment to removing heresy and treason from the Khanid Military Circuit as part of its continuing expedition there.

Syndicate-born Popstar Announces Charity Tour For Syndicate, Placid, and Verge Vendor
Taigeru Beldeia • YC123.04.15

Poitot, Syndicate - Renown Syndicate popstar Ashee Talario, better known by her stage name of Stellaria, has announced a benefit tour to take place in various systems of Syndicate, Placid, and Verge Vendor. The announcement comes ahead of the one year anniversary since the devastating Triglavian Invasion which saw destruction and carnage unfold in every major CONCORD signatory. Stellaria stated that one hundred percent of the funds will be donated to various charities across the three regions.

“It is a somber occasion”, remarked Stellaria’s record label representative. “But Stellaria, ever a star of the people, expressed interest to us in allowing the approval of such a tour. Naturally, our record label was all on board, and we immediately began planning.”

The GalNet social media site of Peeper™ has been abuzz with the hashtag of #Stellaria and #charitytour rising to the top of the trending categories. It appears that many people, especially those Peeper™ users from Syndicate and Placid, appear to be very excited for the upcoming tour.

“My heart goes out to those affected by the events of last year”, peeped one Placid user. “It is sad when it falls upon celebrities and regular people rather than our own government to influence positive change for everyone </3.”

The first show of the tour is set to take place in Poitot, and will make its way through a handful of other systems in the region before moving on to Placid and Verge Vendor. Tickets are already on sale now. I-RED has approved a venue aboard the 6-U2M8 Oriki Commercial Center free of charge in support of the tour.

One Year Following Creation of Intaki-Business Logistics Union, Local Socioeconomic Factors Show Substantial Growth
Koren Akko • YC123.04.15

XS-XAY, Syndicate - It has now been one year since the formation of the Intaki-Business Logistics Union [I-BLU], an investment initiative spearheaded by I-RED. A year’s worth of data have provided all the facts - the formation of I-BLU has improved I-RED’s economic status, but also the economic and security well-being of the 98Q ‘superpocket’ of star systems in the region.

“A most happy one-year birthday to our dear friends and allies within I-BLU”, stated an official I-RED press release. “The individual member corporations of I-BLU share the vision of I-RED for the Intaki Syndicate, and we are happy to work together to build a better future for everyone living here. Together through cooperation and mutual benefit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.”

The date of April 15th is also now officially recognized as a corporate holiday among I-RED and I-BLU. The day was marked by celebrations taking place across all the structures and facilities owned by both organizations.

Parsing through economic data of the local region reveals an impressive increase in the export of refined moon ores as well as planetary-produced goods. Local trade within the superpocket has also seen a notable uptick since the formation of I-BLU, particularly among the stations operated by Ishukone and the various Intaki Syndicate corporations. Surveys from independent research groups have also revealed a rather uniform trend of an increase in overall happiness among inhabitants within the 98Q superpocket - particularly in relation to those of inhabitants in other areas of Syndicate.

Local Crop Failure Woes Calmed by Sisters of Eve Arrangement
Jelvia Taredi • YC123.04.24

Tisot, Aridia - The small Amarrian colony on Tisot III had an extreme crop failure due to a sudden surge in solar energy from the host star. Despite being classified as a temperate planet, Tisot III barely fits the description of a habitable planet. It does boast a powerful natural magnetic field, much stronger than most fields for planets its size, which helps greatly in protecting the planet from the solar radiation of a star. However, in a strange phenomena still under investigation, the star experienced a short-lived burst in energy that overwhelmed the planet’s intrinsic magnetic field. Damage caused to the colony from the solar flare was widespread.

In an emergency agreement between local Amarr officials and Sisters of Eve representatives from the station in the system, SoE agreed to supply the colony with surplus food for the following three months in return for total access to any knowledge gleaned from the investigation into the sudden solar energy emitted by the host star. The SoE also provided medical treatments for irradiation free of charge to the Tisot colonists.

Local Amarrian leadership has considered abandoning the colony completely, but doing so would cause the loss of valuable planetary ore production for the area. Heated debate is expected to ensue in the upcoming weeks regarding the topic. Meanwhile, colonists most injured from the radiation exposure have been transported off-world to appropriate medical facilities for treatment.

Electrical Fire Aboard Intaki Freeport Claims 33 Lives
Federation Associates, edited by Taigeru Beldeia • YC123.04.23

Intaki Freeport Station, Intaki, Placid - An electrical fire in Habitat 8 of the Intaki Diaspora Industrial Freeport led to 33 fatalities five days ago. Station management is blaming the blaze on a black market battery charging operation run by an Aenebra affiliated criminal gang. As reported by I-CRN recently, Habitat 8 has been subject to lockdown protocols following a spate of killings on the station with an unconfirmed connection to the Aenebra Cult - an extremist Idic group of Intaki anarchists.

“Unlicensed charge stations are a significant health and safety risk, as this incident demonstrates. While we are pleased to confirm that our fire containment systems operated effectively within the time required by our risk management KPIs, the intensity of the initial fire means it has not been possible to identify the casualties,” commented station management spokesperson Garudaa en Janmari.

No further killings have been reported since the fire. One Habitat 8 resident declined to speculate on the Aenebra presence there, being more focused on the cost of batteries in lockdown, “We have a 4D Drone Racing League event this weekend and I was counting on those batteries!”

Moreover, this recent incident has sparked renewed attention to the Aenebra Cult by both the public and local security forces. Questions of how Aenebra secure their funding, how expansive their operations are, and what numbers of followers they possess have been topics of intense speculation on various social media platforms. I-RED officials remain quiet on the matter, but a short press statement by Oniseki-Raata Internal Watch - a private security contractor for I-RED - states that I-RED officials are monitoring the situation.

Dubious Nature of Unstated Corporate Mandates Leads to Harroule Dryweed Controversy
Koren Akko • YC123.04.20

Ishukone Corporation Factory V-4, 98Q-8O, Syndicate - It has long been understood that certain drug use, outside of corporate-approved boosters, is generally frowned upon in the State. However, when megacorporations operate abroad, oftentimes they are subject to the local laws of whatever political entity hosts their presence. In the case of Syndicate, laws and regulations surrounding drug use vary wildly from station to station due to the highly independent and autonomous nature of Syndicate stations.

While in years past I-RED has permitted the usage of various strains of Harroule dryweed aboard their facilities in the region, Ishukone Corporation proper has not officially made any stance on the usage of such substances aboard their facilities. This year there was a notable usage of Harroule dryweed among inhabitants of Ishukone Corporation stations across the region that coincided with the unofficial interstellar holiday associated with Harroule dryweed recreational use.

“Hey man, I pay my taxes and take care of my work on time”, professed local Ishukone V-4 resident Yuko Tannolen, his bloodshot eyes clearly giving away his current mental state. “We have every right to enjoy the celebrations of 420 across New Eden. For the State!”, he shouted as he took a quick whiff from his blunt. “Did I mention I pay my taxes and stuff?”

Many Ishukonites and non-Ishukone citizens took the opportunity to enjoy 420 celebrations this year due to a lack of any official mandates against it from local Ishukone officials. Meanwhile, countless fast-food restaurant chains in the area reported all-time high levels of one-day profits because of the phenomena. It remains to be seen if Harroule dryweed usage will continue to be permitted in Ishukone stations in the region.

I-RED Subsidiaries Move to Fortify Ishukone-Amarr Relations in PKN-Dominant Areas
Jelvia Taredi • YC123.06.03

Sarum Prime, Domain - The I-RED subsidiaries of Integrated Health Systems, Ltd. and Myoka Galactic™ have reportedly recently received directives to increase their operations in Empire territory, especially in areas dominated by PKN Interstellar presence. IHS, primarily a manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment, and Myoka, primarily a manufacturer of terrestrial vehicles and interstellar transports, both seem to be trying their best to comply with the new directives.

PKN Interstellar, particularly Lai Dai, is known to have strong connections with various Empire entities. While Ishukone historically has never maintained as strong relations with the Empire as its top corporate rival, Lai Dai, it still makes some effort to stay connected. I-RED, an Ishukone capsuleer subsidiary, has generally operated on a very pro-Empire stance, and currently maintains close relations with prominent Empire-affiliated capsuleer groups such as the Praetoria Excubitoris Imperialis [PIE] and Khimi Harar [LUMEN] organizations. I-RED and LUMEN are even a part of a trio of capsuleer alliances which together form the substantial Syndicate Coalition [SynCo], an organization dedicated to the prosperity of Syndicate.

While no official statements from either IHS or Myoka Galactic™ have been released, it is theorized that IHS will focus on enhancing their presence within Tash-Murkon and Khanid territories, while Myoka will attempt to entrench themselves deeper in Kor-Azor and Sarum territories. While the development of subcranial nanocontrollers by Lai Dai following their controversial raids into Intaki Prime Idic monasteries has hurt transcranial microcontroller profits of IHS, the company has moved to develop alternative cybernetic augmentations to compensate for losses. The shift in product development does seem to have had a positive effect on mitigating losses due to the SCNC technological developments.

Meanwhile, Myoka has focused on expanding their network to Kor-Azor and Sarum territories for a variety of reasons. House Kor-Azor operates on similar economic principles of Ishukone in that both entities have a vision set on internationalism in order to optimize economic growth. Meanwhile, the expansionist mindset of House Sarum bodes well for a terrestrial vehicle and interstellar transport manufacturer such as Myoka Galactic™. Furthermore, I-RED already has existing relations with House Sarum due to their allyship with PIE, who has numerous prominent Sarumites such as the renown Lady Mitara Newelle.

Whether the recent developments will have any effect on mitigating the encroaching influences of PKN Interstellar members remains to be seen. But at the very least, I-RED is making attempts to assert a stronger Combine TNR presence in the Amarr Empire.

Sightings of Enforcers in Republic Space Spark Rumors of Normalization of Relations Between I-RED and the Republic
Taigeru Beldeia • YC123.06.05

Reppola Logistic Support, XS-XAY, Syndicate - It has been many years since I-RED has formally engaged in relations with the Republic or Republic-aligned entities. I-RED is thought to have held a long-standing positive relationship with the Republic prior to the incident which led to the escape of Hilen Tukoss, a former Zainou employee who escaped with stolen assets to the Republic. Tukoss was a fugitive running from Ishukone Watch authorities, who were intercepted and destroyed by the Republic-aligned capsuleer groups of Electus Matari [EM] and Ushra’Khan [UK]. I-RED operatives who were also in pursuit were unable to reach the scene in time to prevent Tukoss from escaping to the Republic.

The aforementioned event signalled the collapse of I-RED relations with Republic entities. The long-running Cal-Matari Program, under the management of ethnic Matari Korbin “Korsavius” Lavius soon shut down its operations following the Tukoss incident. I-RED assets were swiftly pulled from Republic space, or liquidated. And diplomatic relations between I-RED and the most prominent Republic capsuleer groups were promptly set to hostile.

However, recent leaked footage of Enforcer vessels operating in Republic territory have sparked interest in speculative viewers. There are now rumors floating about that the existence of such footage proves that the normalization of relations between I-RED and Republic entities is on the horizon. The I-RED Directorship has not publicly commented on the matter besides denying any such speculations.

Still, to those baseliners who remember the benefits of such programs as the Cal-Matari Program, hope remains that one day I-RED will return to the Republic ready to engage in mutually beneficial economic initiatives.

I-RED Expands Customs Office Network in Response to Placid-Solitude Gate Connection
Selenna Solange • YC123.05.31

Yvelet, Solitude - I-RED has recently engaged in aggressive customs office expansion operations throughout the region of Solitude following the construction of the Kenninck-Eggheron stargate. The operations are a pre-emptive measure to counterbalance the loss in profits of a wide range of businesses in Syndicate following the construction of the gate.

I-RED has firmly opposed the construction of the new stargate, which would link Solitude to the mainland Federation. Independent research conducted and published by I-RED revealed a loss in profit in a number of industries in Syndicate as a result of such a stargate connection, including but not limited to: restaurants, hotels, fuel stations, and pleasure centers. Now that travelers between the mainland Federation and Solitude no longer need to traverse through Syndicate, many businesses will experience a loss in profits. Businesses led by hardworking families, argues the I-RED sponsored research. As a result, a portion of the profits of the new expansion of Solitude customs offices is set to be earmarked for economic stimulus injections for a variety of Syndicate businesses.

“I-RED has and will continue to represent the best interest of the Intaki people living in Syndicate. The construction of the new stargate is just another brutal slap to the face of the Intaki Syndicate by the Gallente Federation”, passionately spoke Roirdan Bouchate, a prominent figurehead of I-RED. “The Federation has stated ‘we do not need you anymore’ with this new gate, and the customs office expansion is just one way that I-RED plans to intervene on behalf of the hardworking families of Syndicate. The Syndicate will endure as it always has, and we will be there to help.”

Pressure Mounts on Combine TNR to Act Following Numerous PKN Interstellar Controversies
Koren Akko • YC123.06.06

Malkalen, Lonetrek - Following a spate of controversies from PKN Interstellar members, pressure is mounting on Combine TNR members to issue formal statements. Among the PKN controversies includes: diverting funds meant for State Armed Forces and Jita 4-4 remodeling to executive wallets, firing live rounds into protests, and sociopolitical fallout from the Intaki Prime invasions. Both Combine TNR and JSL Partnership have been quiet over the last couple of years as a result of dealing with the fallout from the devastating Triglavian Collective invasions in YC122.

“Dark Forest has clearly indicated their dark intentions and dishonorable behavior unbefitting of a true State mega”, commented one Ishukone accountant who wished to remain anonymous. “They are a threat to the State at this point, and the CEP should band together to punish PKN for embezzling funds meant to go to our military.”

“Why has Combine TNR been so f***ing quiet?! Ancestor’s choke, Reppola is failing where Gariushi wouldn’t…I miss him”, stated Iskeitan Navorlen of the Ishukone Watch.

Indeed, there have been numerous demonstrations aboard I-RED Upwell facilities in the 98Q superpocket in Syndicate against PKN Interstellar. Rumors have been circulating that the I-RED Directorship has considered sanctions against PKN Interstellar affiliates, but a lack of any official statement by Combine TNR has withheld leadership from carrying out any such sanctions. For the meantime, however, I-RED continues to maintain economic relations with numerous PKN Interstellar entities, much to the dismay of many baseliner employees.

Meanwhile, in direct contrast to normal operations in the past, I-RED has made moves to establish stronger relations with the JSL Partnership. On the Sukuuvestaa front, Vice-Admiral Korbin Lavius takes the lead for initiating stronger connections. Lavius, a former SuVee citizen himself, reportedly has numerous connections in both SuVee and the Peace and Order Unit with which to build a stronger foundation between them and I-RED. Establishing greater relations with Kaalakiota meanwhile has proven more difficult, as both KK and I-RED have been very vocal opponents of each other in years past, especially while KK was headed by Tibus Heth and his Provist regime.

I-RED Graciously Accepts Donation of Yak Cheese from LUMEN Pilot
Jelvia Taredi • YC123.06.10

Reppola Logistic Support, XS-XAY, Syndicate - I-RED has recently received a considerable shipment of high-quality Yak cheese wheels donated by Akali Sharisa of Khimi Harar [LUMEN]. The cheese wheels were shipped from Mehatoor, where Sharisa also made a donation to various food pantries located in the 24th Imperial Crusade station in the system. The donations to I-RED are reportedly surplus cheese produced by the Yak herds managed by Sharisa.

“Ah, the gift of cheese. This is surely a sign of strong bonds between the various organizations which make up the Syndicate Coalition”, commented one Syndicate political analyst. “The cheese donation comes just a little over a year after LUMEN donated a herd of Yaks to the Intaki-Business Logistics Union [I-BLU].”

“Good cheese leads to good bones leads to good citizens of Syndicate”, peeped one Peeper™ user, SyndiCAN_12345. The peep has received hundreds of re-peeps and likes on the social media site.

“Yak cheese? Er, well…umm, I have been wanting to try out some different charcuterie board ideas with Selenna”, stated I-RED manager Roirdan Bouchate as he was ambushed by reporters during the gift reception event aboard the XS-XAY Reppola Logistic Support.

Bonds between the three member alliances of SynCo appear to only grow stronger over time. The future looks bright for members of the Syndicate Coalition. And full of cheese.

Uptick in Licensing and Rental Agreements
Federation Associates, edited by Taigeru Beldeia • YC123.06.11

MXYS-8, Syndicate - Much of Syndicate has seen a recent rise in demand for a basket of station services, say sources within Intaki Commerce. Both hangar rental and shipping licenses have shown moderate increases over the past week, as new entrants to the market expand their operations throughout the region.

In a move that appears to be at odds with the anticipated decrease in traffic volumes due to the newly inaugurated Placid-Solitude jump gate, bullish speculation is balancing out the bears. While entrenched organizations, such as the Intaki-Business Logistics Union, have reported increased interest in cooperative ventures by mineral extraction groups, any potential agreements have yet to be solidified.

“We think Syndicate is as vibrant as it’s ever been and continues to provide opportunity for both immigrants and transient business interests”, wrote Borrin Aubonnie of Intaki Commerce in a recent press release. Ms. Aubonnie is the director of warehousing operations on MXYS-8 II Station and oversees security for constellation-level shipping.

While initial projections seem to indicate a spur in economic activity following the new gate activation, it remains to be seen whether this will hold up over time for the region of Syndicate. Various sources on GalNet report a flurry of interest in creating a new market either in Solitude or Placid following the new gate connection. Such a new market could either hurt, or contribute to economic activity in Syndicate.

Chatelain Auxiliary Response Opens Infomorph Dedicated Medical Facility
Taigeru Beldeia • YC123.06.20

Stacmon, Placid - The first fully dedicated infomorph wellness center in Placid has opened with the CHTAR Astrahus-class citadel aptly named “Infomorph Wellness Center.” A ribbon cutting ceremony was held where leaders within the Intaki-Business Logistics Union [I-BLU] and Ishuk-Raata Enforcement Directive [I-RED] were present. CHTAR has announced that all of its infomorph-related services so far are now operational, which include high-grade biomass for clones, bespoke cloning and medical centers for purchase, analgesic therapies related to the Harroule native plant khuska, and gel-matrix biopaste for cybernetic applications.

“This project has been a long time in the making”, stated CHTAR CEO Auriga Menkalinan eagerly during the opening ceremony. “However, it is far from complete. CHTAR along with our colleague corporations in I-BLU as well as our other associates in Syndicate have more infomorph-related projects we wish to work on and host aboard this new facility. I look forward to what the future holds!”

Various leases are available within the facility for independent vendors to acquire and host their products and services. Already a number of slots have been taken up by various corporations related to infomorph technology and services. Notable among them include a prominent capsuleer spa retreat provider from Syndicate, Rejuvenation Glen. Rejuvenation Glen has a number of capsuleers spas located throughout Syndicate, and they are renowned for their expert care and attention to the needs of capsuleer clients, as well as for the immense quality of their relaxation techniques and materials.

Also present are infomorph psychotherapy experts from I-RED’s Ishukone-Raata Technological Research Institute (I-RTI). These individuals have signed working contracts to join forces with Chatelain BioPharma, who also has a notable presence onboard the facility and provides various therapies and counseling services to infomorphs.

Guristas Sotiyo Removed From Syndicate
Koren Akko • YC123.06.25

Syndicate - In an unprecedented move, over a week ago the Guristas Pirates managed to set up a Sotiyo-class engineering complex along with other fortifications deep within the 98Q “superpocket” of systems in which I-RED and other Syndicate Coalition members I-BLU and LUMEN resides. Guristas forces proceeded to attack various structures in the system they set up shop in, succeeding in reinforcing an I-RED Athanor-class refinery. However, over this weekend the invaders were successfully repelled, and the Sotiyo was destroyed by a third-party entity.

It remains unclear how Guristas forces were able to bypass detection measures employed by I-RED in order to anchor the massive engineering complex. Once the facility was anchored, Guristas forces got to work engaging in piracy operations in the system. A number of independent convoys were raided, including a I-RED relay station and an Intaki Space Police military arms convoy. At the time, Ishukone-Raata Enforcer Fleet scout teams were no match for the much larger and well-organized Guristas raiding fleets. A retreat of I-REF forces was done, and a travel advisory was broadcasted on all local channels in order to minimize loss of life and property by traveling independent groups.

A combined defense force consisting of I-RED, I-BLU, and LUMEN formed to defend the Athanor refinery, and succeeded in repelling the Guristas fleet that had assembled on the inbound gate, as well as the structure itself. An anonymous third party entity then engaged the Sotiyo shipyard itself and destroyed the facility along with its defense taskforce, bringing an end to almost a week of havoc caused by Guristas.

I-RED Subsidiary Transport Searched While Cutting Through Republic
Selenna Solange • YC123.07.02

Hyasyoda Corporation Mineral Reserve, Airaken, The Forge - An Integrated Health Systems, Ltd. transport vessel that cut through Republic territory from Deltole to Airaken was stopped and boarded while making a stop in Hadozeko of Metropolis. IHS is a subsidiary of I-RED, and focuses on producing high-grade medical cybernetics along with other medical supplies. Controversial among their line of products among advocacy groups from the Federation and Republic are transcranial microcontrollers. It is suspected that because of this, Republic authorities halted the vessel while it was docked and performed an extensive search of its contents.

“Tribal security forces were acting on pure superstition and ill will when they performed this unwarranted hazing operation against our employees”, lambasted IHS CEO Ku Mayaseki. “The operation is clearly designed to deter the process of free trade in the cluster, and one that will be remembered in the future.”

The crew of the IHS transport fully complied with the directives of the Republic police forces, and the whole process which took over two hours to complete resulted in no contraband discovered. The transport was promptly allowed to exit the station and resume its business. Following the search operation, the transport linked up with an Ishukone-Raata Enforcer Fleet taskforce dispatched to provide additional security escort.

I-RED Directorship has not provided any additional comments regarding the situation, but it is likely that they will side with the position of IHS. Meanwhile, I-RCN attempted to reach out for comment from the Republic Justice Department enforcement branch but has not heard back yet.

Trending “Presidential Peripheral” Hairstyle Remains Strong Even After Federation Day Celebrations
Taigeru Beldeia • YC123.07.04

Stacmon, Placid - Considerably long after the Federation Day celebrations of YC123, a unique phenomena of trending hairstyles in the image of current Federation President Celes Aguard remains strong. Many non-capsuleers have taken a liking to the trend of mimicry started by numerous capsuleers wishing to celebrate the current presidential administration. Wigs modeling the “presidential peripheral”, as some within the fashion industry are calling it, have been flying out of stock in the weeks leading up to Fed Day and since.

“Like, I’m totally a creature of culture, I’ll admit”, confessed Stacmon citizen Jinalle Fourease as she moved a strand of her neon green presidential peripheral hairstyle. “I just really love the fashion-forward style of our current president. We love to see it.”

Hashtags on the social media platform Peeper™ dedicated to the hairstyle remain strong in the trending categories even now. It is hard to predict how long this trend will last. Some suspect that ambitious fashion entrepreneurs will attempt to export the crazy trend to the Republic for the upcoming Liberation Day celebrations. It remains to be seen whether or not these attempts will come into fruition - and if they will be successful or not.

Ishukone Subsidiary Tackles Triglavian Troublemakers and Celebrates Launch of First DST
State Associates, edited by Koren Akko • YC123.07.03

Jita, The Forge - Tereven Shipping has announced the successful completion of the maiden voyage of it’s first deep space transport. The TSC Kauppias, a Bustard recently registered to the young Ishukone subsidiary corporation, departed from the Jita system for the first time in the early morning hours and safely returned with it’s hold filled to the brim shortly before lunch time.

“She earned her price back twice in record time”, stated the corporation’s capsuleer pilot and CEO Miran Tereven. “We expected to launch our first DST in the second quarter of YC122, but the moment the CEP mobilised the entire citizenry to defend our people against the Triglavian menace, we knew business ambitions had to be set aside for duty”, the decorated former Senior Fleet Commander of EDI elaborated.

When asked why now was the right time to set aside the humble Tayra for the able Bustard, Captain Tereven explained that during the invasions TSC’s revenue went towards putting new capsuleers in “proper Caldari warships” such as the Naga, Ferox and Osprey and that during the four months immediately after the invasions TSC’s efforts went towards transporting displaced citizens to New Caldari Prime, but that the abysmal performance of the Kybernauts during a recent punitive expedition to Pochven convinced her that the time to free up the corporation’s ISK reserves to invest in better non-combat hardware had finally come. “We destroyed three structures that day. I tackled 31 ships without losing my Crow. It’s almost like they stopped resisting.”

Upon being questioned about what the future has in store, Captain Tereven hinted that she expects to expand from shipping to colony management before the end of the year to create jobs and housing for citizens displaced by the invaders, with further plans for a Union Day tournament intended to fund internships for those orphaned by the war.

I-RED and SynCo Secure Presence of Every Upwell Facility in 98Q “Superpocket”
Selenna Solange • YC123.07.28

VV-VCR, Syndicate - After nearly a month long negotiation process with a rival capsuleer group in Syndicate, I-RED along with the rest of their Syndicate Coalition [SynCo] allies have managed to secure ownership of every Upwell facility in the 98Q superpocket of systems, a combination of the MK7-AO and JQV5-9 constellations. On top of this, SynCo also owns the vast majority of all planetary customs offices within the superpocket.

“The acquisition of this facility from its previous occupants marks a milestone in the continuation of our vision to promote an economically diverse and prosperous Intaki Syndicate”, stated I-RED Executor Alex Hinkelmann in a public briefing. “I-RED has worked hard alongside our allies to carve out this pocket of Syndicate. We aim to be a model for progress built on the principles of free trade, cooperation, and innovation.”

The latest Upwell acquisition, an Athanor-class refinery, has been rechristened with the name of Dvaar Extraction Facility. In ancient Intaki, “dvaar” loosely translates to “gateway”, which seemed fitting given that VV-VCR functions as the gateway into the entire 98Q superpocket.

Amarrian Nationals and Expatriates Aboard I-RED Facilities Prepare for Foundation Day Celebrations
Jelvia Taredi • YC123.07.24

Oriki Commercial Center, 6-U2M8, Syndicate - Many people currently or formerly loyal to the Imperial Throne are busying themselves with preparing for the upcoming annual Foundation Day holiday. I-RED, being a longtime supporter of the Empire, recognizes Foundation Day as a corporate holiday and non-essential personnel are granted the day off for their celebrations. Given the notable population of Amarrian expats currently employed as corporate citizens with I-RED, the move only made sense.

“I plan on using the day off, as well as some paid time off, to make a pilgrimage to my home on Tash-Murkon Prime with my family”, stated Tash-Murkonite Armin Eshad. “And of course you can bet I will be using a SynCo Tours shuttle to get there!”

It is rumored that the I-RED Directorship will be more public regarding supporting celebrations for Foundation Day this year. This is, in part, due to a rise in the influence of Sedevacantism across the cluster - a heretical interpretation of the Amarrian faith espoused by the infamous capsuleer Nauplius. Syndicate became one of the focus points for Nauplius to spread the roots of his twisted ideology, and I-RED has worked in tandem with their fellow Syndicate Coalition ally of Khimi Harar [LUMEN] to combat the spread of the faith in the region.

Representatives from I-RED are expected to participate in the various celebrations hosted by both LUMEN and PIE for Foundation Day. The cooperation and participation are expected to be symbolic of the strong ties between the Amarr Empire and Caldari State.

Rogue AI and Capsuleer Drama: A Brief Update

Eugales, Placid - The situation between the United Neopian Federation [UNF] and investigating DERAIL units in the system seems to have escalated recently. There has been reports that DERAIL marines are actively conducting counter-subversion actions on all storm world planets in the system of Eugales. One of these planets happens to be the location of a major terraforming initiative spearheaded by the UNF, who also maintain an ongoing orbital infrastructure project.

Rumors have been circulating that the UNF is engaging in illegal research of advanced AI, contrary to the universal laws which were installed against such research following the creation of rogue drones. These rumors are further supported by evidence and leaks from conspiracy theorists that UNF maintains allyship with various kybernaut entities. I-RCN has been unable to determine the veracity of such rumors.

Meanwhile, I-RCN has received news that the capsuleer fanclub which has skyrocketed in popularity lately, the Cormorants and Jackals corporation, has been the target of a raid in Luminaire. The joint raid by Federal and CONCORD forces turned up several million ISK worth of “contraband” goods, which have not been publicly released by the public relations officer for the ongoing investigation. Peeper™ feeds in the region have lit up crying out against the injustice of the raid against Cormorants and Jackals, mainly from C&J members themselves or those who have viewed their meteoric rise with comical interest. Could this spell the end of the C&J fanclub for good? The whereabouts of C&J founder Julian Flavours remain unknown at this time. A manhunt is reportedly being conducted by Federal forces.

I-RED Re-enlists in State Protectorate in Response to Heightened Activity in Viriette
Koren Akko • YC123.07.23

Harroule, Placid - A change in short term plans sees I-RED re-enlisting in faction warfare in response to heightened capsuleer activity in Placid, particularly in and around the Intaki system. While I-RED has not been an active participant in the CEWPA warzone for some time now, plans were to re-enlist at some point in the future following a continued initiative to claim planetary customs offices in Solitude as a result of the Eggheron-Kenninck stargate construction. The recent Federal Defence Union push to recapture Intaki and the surrounding systems has accelerated I-RED’s re-enlistment.

“A priority of I-RED remains the safety, security, and stability of Intaki and the surrounding colonies”, stated I-RED Executor Alex Hinkelmann in a recent interview. “Following the disastrous events of a couple years ago with the Lai Dai Corporation incursion into Intaki Prime, we have amplified our level of mutual cooperation with the Intaki Assembly and other Intaki-based allies. The FDU push to retake the system will hinder our efforts, thus the Directorship has made the move to accelerate the rejoining of the alliance into the warzone.”

Korbin Lavius, a prominent figure within I-RED, also had some comments regarding the situation in Placid. “I-RED is a staunch supporter of the Intaki Assembly, and the Intaki Syndicate. It is our sincere hope that the recent activity amongst capsuleers in the area will accelerate plans regarding the potential of the Intaki Space Police gaining the security and franchise contract for the Intaki system. I, for one, wholly endorse ISP as a competent and proficient organization, and I firmly believe they will excel in the role.” For his part, Vice Admiral Lavius has been known to function as a freelance agent completing work for the ISP in Syndicate.

FDU-aligned groups, namely Aideron Robotics, seem determined to make a push for stronger FDU presence in the Viriette constellation. I-RCN is unable to verify at this time the reason for their motivations, but we suspect it may be aligned with the vision of the current Federation president. Time will tell to see how the sociopolitical landscape of Viriette and the rest of Placid will play out.

The Onuoto Eskeitan Station in high orbit of Intaki Prime
Intaki, Placid - Following a meeting of executive member from various branches of the Enforcement Directive Board of Directors, investors with interests within the Viriette constellation were informed of a change in focus regarding the Ishukone-Raata Viriette Commerce Expansion Zone. An initiative which saw the organization officially enter the CEWPA warzone in late July.

“Between Federal systems falling to Caldari occupation at a increased rate, the Combine TNR Colonial development claim over the Intaki System, and unwarranted PKN aggression. The board see the increasing need to adapt accordingly with this dynamic situation.”, read the board’s official release. “It is our wish to remain in step with our colleagues, and partners within the Tiuunakama Nenkanavu Rymasaikkan. While staying true to our decade-long commitment to the safety, prosperity and stability of the Intaki system.”

Alexandre Hinkelmann, the Executor of I-RED, issued a conclusive list of changes to the project. Highlighting the need to coordinate an end to the conflict within the Intaki system through diplomatic means by “opening diplomatic talks with prominent Enlisted Federal Defence Forces, in an attempt to lobby members of the Senate, Assembly, and Executive Panel as a unified voice.”

Executives within I-RED have also adjusted the bounds in which paramilitary forces under the Ishukone-Raata security directive can operate, specifically toward PKN aligned forces inside the Combine TNR development claim.

Some of these have already proven to be controversial, such as the creation of a vaguely defined “Intaki Integrity Task-Force” with sole objective to intercept any suspected PKN craft within the Intaki system. The main point of contention looks to be focused on the newly anchored Onuoto Eskeitan Station, more commonly known as the Intaki TNR Colonial Monitoring Facility, which is now in orbit of Intaki Prime.

Many of these drastic changes appear to be attempts to further solidify efforts to hinder any attempts at another PKN incursion into the area. It is unclear as to the degree of success they’ll see at this time.

Undisclosed Joint-PLESCO Operation
Intaki, Placid - Earlier this month negotiations 1 were concluded, detailing the wide reaching cooperative measures between the Ishukone-Raata Enforcement Directive and their newfound partners among the Rezeki-Osmon affiliate organization regarding their mutual Intaki interests.

Since conclusion of these negotiations, members of the Directive have admitted to meeting several more times in a effort to further solidify and ultimately form a TNR Capsuleer Interest Group. Making way for the formation of a official economic and security coalition force.

“This Coalition will not only focus on the mutual interests of member groups within the Intaki solar system, but TNR interests in Placid as a whole.” Alexandre Hinkelmann stated “In doing so, our aim is to prove to the interstellar business community that the State is more then capable of ensuring continued economic growth, stability, and security within controlled Placid systems.”

During the security outline segment of the closed door conference, Shiran Mazaki stated the name of the new coalition (consisting of both the Ishuk-Raata [I-RED] and State Public [SPD]) would be known as the Placid Economic Security Commission or PLESCO.

When inquiries were made about the SCOPE reports of pirate and smuggling issues under State occupied systems Mazaki claimed “Unfounded, that’s what these claims are.” but also admitted to Federation aligned privateers disrupting trade in Ostingele, and went on to cite several successful police actions to keep the trade lanes clear.

While criticism is expected to be drawn from Federal opponents, many supporters recall the past anti-pirate actions persisted by the Ishukone-Raata Enforcement Directive during YC114-116 and expect positive development in the region. Especially with their allied forces in the State Public Defenders.

Tereven Security Joins PLESCO as Placid War Rages
Koren Akko - 124.04.30

Agoze, Placid - The last bastion of the Placid Economic Security Commission rests in a relative stable state, after the Caldari States grip on the Placid region crumbled under the weight of the renewed efforts of the Federal Defense Union.

In recent weeks PLESCO has renewed an offensive in the Viriette constellation against the privateer organization under the FDU banner, known as Cruisers Crew, conducting relentless attacks against space-borne structures under their control. While reports have shown that little ground has been made by either side when it comes to the stations themselves, recent fleet engagements have proven disastrous for joint-FDU operations in the constellation. All of which has resulted in a estimated loss of 31 billion ISK to FDU forces since the beginning of this offensive, the loss of a FDU operated construction facility in the Pain system, compared to the 5.2 billion ISK loss of PLESCO Assets - which includes the destruction of the SPD Agoze HQ.

BREAKING: I-RED Raid Syndicate Facility Connected to Aenebra Cult
Selenna Solange • YC124.07.01

M2-CF1, Syndicate - An unmarked trade outpost was raided based on a months-long investigation by joint I-RED and Intaki Space Police forces. The facility seemed innocent enough, and was registered only as a private trade outpost operated by an independent mining corporation. The surprise raid yielded the arrest of three dozen individuals affiliated with the Aenebra cult, which has gained traction in the last couple years for their antics - most notably for assassinations of station government officials in Syndicate.

While in the past the Aenebra cult has mostly been relegated to operating in Placid, they have recently made a name for themselves in the region of Syndicate. A string of high-profile assassinations in the region have been linked to Aenebra, whom are an Intaki “death cult” infamous for their drugs, rituals, and assassinations.

Leading the sting operation was I-RED’s Shiran Mazaki and Korbin Lavius. Commander Mazaki lead a taskforce consisting of frigates and cruisers to rapidly storm the airspace around the facility. Once the path was cleared, Vice-Admiral Lavius jumped in a Chimera-class carrier and proceeded to launch boarding craft. A brief firefight ensued outside the station as a small fleet of frigates and fighters was assembled, but it was quickly dispatched by Mazaki’s taskforce. The fight inside the facility, however, was more drawn out.

Casualties on I-RED’s side were minimal, but higher than expected. Aenebra associates who weren’t killed outright were all detained by I-RED forces once the battle settled. Inside scan-proof vaults were hundreds of metric tons of illicit contraband - from drugs to weapons to counterfeit scrip. More importantly, however, were personal electronics which are believed to contain information regarding Aenebra operations.

It is believed that Aenebra was using this outpost as a waypoint to conduct some of its operations in the eastern portions of Syndicate. All discovered contraband was delivered to the local ISP offices located in IIRH-G. The detainees are currently being held in detention by I-RED in VV-VCR. While the operation is being labeled as an overall success, some critics couldn’t help but voice their criticism.

One Federal Defense Union strategists mentioned in a public statement following announcement of the raid, “I-RED’s headquarters in Syndicate is a mere one jump away from where the Aenebra were operating out of. You’re telling me it took them this long to figure out what was going on underneath their nose? Perhaps the Enforcement Directive isn’t as competent as some may believe…”

In response, one of the leaders of the operation, Vice-Admiral Lavius, had this to say, “Comments from Federal officials on the competency of I-RED are moot. They should focus on negotiating and completing the Intaki security franchise - which has been dragging on for years now - instead of worrying about matters that do not concern them. As for Aenebra operating so closely to I-RED, they made use of a neutrally registered private mining corporation to effectively hide in plain sight for so long. A technique that would have continued to be effective were it not for the collaborative efforts of I-RED and ISP investigators.”

I-RED Fulfills Security Contract Obligation With Syndicate Clients
Selenna Solange • YC124.07.01

VV-VCR, Syndicate - I-RED has routinely taken part of security operations related to border security on behalf of numerous Syndicate clients. Within recent weeks, one of these contracts fulfilled was border security protection following the increase in traffic related to the Federation Grand Prix.

“The possibility of a massive influx of capsuleer traffic in and through Syndicate poses a danger to some of our clients”, remarked one security analyst working in I-RED who wished to remain anonymous. “Every year there are individuals who attempt to pass through Syndicate to sell their illicit goods on the black market, which destabilizes local markets and has a negative effect on the livelihoods of Syndicate residents.”

I-RED has, to a lesser degree than last year, engaged in gate patrols to help monitor and enforce the type of capsuleer traffic flowing in and out of the region. Many capsuleer vessels were halted or prompted to follow specific directions, and those that did not were fired upon and neutralized. Post-damage analysis of ship contents revealed the presence of illicit goods in many of the vessels which were stopped.

Some critics of I-RED claim that the stunt was merely a facade for I-RED conducting illegal search and destroy missions to build up with corporate wallet.

One Federation Senator, who wished to remain unnamed stated, “I-RED’s “security operations” in Syndicate represent a fine example of Caldari anti-Federation meddling. Their attempt to ruin the spirit of Federation Day, and the Federation Grand Prix is laughable at best.”

I-RED security command refused to comment further on the matter.

Strange Cloud Phenomena Subject of Scientific Study
Koren Akko • YC124.07.01

Athounon, Placid - One of the major points of interest in the Athounon system over the last couple weeks has been an apparently abandoned EDENCOM outpost over the planet Athounon V. The structure has had a malfunctioning cloaking device, and, interestingly, is surrounded by a cloud of electromagnetically-active activity.

While it remains to be seen as to whether the occurrence of the electrical activity in the gas cloud has any significance, it has nonetheless been the interest of some scientific study. Julianni Avala of I-RED has spearheaded an Ishukone-Raata Technological Research Institute (I-RTI) field study into the gas cloud phenomena.

“I have considered it [researching the cloud phenomena], but I’m no scientist myself and lack scientific equipment”, admitted Avala while commenting on the subject on the Intergalactic Summit.

In a brief field study spearheaded by Avala and her I-RTI associates, it was determined that frequency of the electrical activity occurs every 60 seconds. Furthermore, the color of the lightning varies from red to a blue-white hue, and appears relatively evenly spread across the cloud.

“The occurrence of the electrical activity every 60 seconds definitely raises some questions”, commented one scientific analyst. “The frequency is unnatural and suggests that something, somewhere is causing the electrical discharge. Perhaps more study can be directed into studying the energy discharge emanating from the EDENCOM structure and how it relates to the electrical activity in the gas cloud around it. Or, maybe even if there is an association between the electrical activity of the cloud with the storm planet below.”

In addition to I-RED efforts, there have been numerous attempts by other organizations to study more about this mysterious, abandoned structure. The situation has been rather complicated since I-RED is abiding by orders directly from the CEP with regards to engaging in non-State Protectorate or Caldari Navy forces in the orbit of Athounon V.

I-RCN will continue to monitor developments as they come.

Summer of Fashion Opening Fashion Show Dazzles Audience in Poitot
Taigeru Beldeia • YC124.06

Poitot, Syndicate - The Summer of Fashion, a three-month celebration of fashion and design that takes place in Syndicate and adjacent regions, has begun with the start of July. The opening fashion show took place today in Poitot with much coverage.

This year the theme of the opening show centered on “Into the Jungle” as a metaphor for diving into what is expected to be a busy and chaotic year for Summer of Fashion. The venue was even outfitted for the theme of the year, with special displays of tropical and exotic flora and animatronic animals. Temperature and humidity control modules helped to provide an extra layer of immersion for the show. Food and drink were inspired from tropical areas of Intaki Prime.

Many of the usual fashion houses made powerful entrances with their entries into the show. Haus Porteau, brand for the illustrious Syndicate fashion mogul Rudy “Roo” Porteau, stunned audiences with his entry which was inspired by the former tropical paradise that was the Mannar homeworld.

“The lead Haus Porteau entry was phenomenal, magical, it captured the moment”, marveled one fashion critic, Jean DuPonte. “The emerald green strips of fabric were embossed in translucent material which shimmered in the walkway lights. The fit of the dress on the female model was both flattering and elegant. The added holographic touch of accessory ribbons of fabric fluttering in the wind was magical. Marvelous, just marvelous.”

Summer of Fashion has been trending on the popular social media site, Peeper™, with thousands of people putting out their thoughts into the universe.

“This summer is set to be a fierce one, with new and old design houses amping up the competition - my body is ready! #SummerofFashion”, peeped user Syndiboi4lyf.

Another user, J_fashion, peeped, “I can’t wait to get my hands on the summer catalog for Haus Porteau! My wardrobe needs some major updates girl. #SummerofFashion”

The opening fashion show concluded with a grand holographic fireworks show inside the Intaki Syndicate station in Poitot. I-RCN will continue monitoring major fashion developments throughout the Summer of Fashion.

BREAKING: Explosion on Utpattia Colony Space Elevator
Selenna Solange • YC124.07.09

A-3ES3, Syndicate - One of the minor elevator lifts, part of the Atlas-Cloudfront Space Elevator System (ACSES), experienced an explosion while transporting down to the terrestrial city of Atlas from the Cloudfront waypoint station along the space elevator tract. The explosion happened at 1400 local time, and exact casualties are currently unknown.

“We are currently investigating the cause of the explosion on the Gamma lift”, ACSES operations chief Ishvan Taliguri stated in a recent press release. “I am able to report that the emergency force field capture net deployed in time at the Atlas ground terminal to stop a majority of the Gamma lift debris from making contact with the surface. There was some minor damage sustained to the Atlas ground terminal by smaller debris, but no casualties as a result of the debris crashing to the surface. As of right now, we are estimating the casualty list to reach ten, but still have more components to sift through for final confirmation. The bodies of five elevator lift workers have been recovered thus far.”

The explosion occurred approximately 40 kilometers above the Atlas ground terminal, about 60 kilometers below the orbital city of Cloudfront. Preliminary investigative results suggest that the explosion occurred as a result of a lapse in containment for pressurized gas fuel being transported to the surface; the break in containment had to have had some kind of activation, however, which is unknown at this time.

The ACSES transport operations on the adjacent Beta and Delta lifts have been suspended for the time being. The further Alpha, Epsilon, and Zeta lifts are still operational, as well as the smaller personnel transport lifts which encircle the much larger minor lifts. The ACSES is designed by the same space elevator engineering firm which designed and built the popular and efficient space elevator used by the Hyasyoda capital, Arvo, on the planet Abagawa IV in The Forge. The lift is hexagonal in shape and is composed of six minor lifts which can operate independently, or be interlinked depending on the needs of the cargo being ferried to and from the surface. At junctional points of each minor lift are smaller, specialized lifts which can carry anything from personnel to fuel to water or whatever else the colony needs.

Thankfully, the Gamma lift was operating independently when the explosion occurred, although it was originally scheduled to be linked to the adjacent Beta and Delta lifts to transport an array of construction materials. However, the schedule was changed last minute in the morning of the incident.

This is the first time the colony of Utpattia has ever experienced an event like this. Many colonial residents are shocked that such an event has rocked their quiet paradise. Already social media and other news outlets are tossing around different theories as to how and why the explosion occurred.

“Isn’t it obvious?”, commented one Peeper™ user, EssentiallyEd. “I-RED raided and captured a bunch of Aenebra cult scumbags in Syndicate just the other week. Then this happens today. They should hire me already onto their police force to take care of this kind of work.”

Another prevailing theory seems to be that this was the work of some Black Eagles operation in response to the Caldari militia, which I-RED is a part of, taking and keeping hold of the hotly contested Serthoulde constellation.

I-RCN will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates to the ongoing investigation.

UPDATE: Atlas Space Elevator Bombing Confirmed Aenebra Cult Operation
Selenna Solange • YC124.07.21

A-3ES3, Syndicate - The results of an investigation into an explosion which occurred on the Utpattia Protectorate colonial space elevator system have revealed that it was indeed an intentional act committed by Aenebra Cult members. As for the cause of the explosion itself, it was found that an Aenebra Cult member posed himself as a space elevator worker and managed to set up a makeshift bomb. The affected lift has since been fully repaired and is expected to re-enter full operation by the end of the weekend.

“After completely sifting through the remains of the Gamma lift, we were able to determine the final casualty count of 12, including the suicidal Aenebra Cult operative”, stated Ishvan Taliguri, operations chief for the Atlas-Cloudfront Space Elevator System (ACSES). “We here at ACSES mourn the loss of the brave men and women who make a living doing honest and good work here in Syndicate. Utpattia is lesser without their presence, but we will continue to remain strong in the face of this cowardly terrorist attack.”

A memorial ceremony for those lives lost is planned for this upcoming week. It is expected the city of Atlas will commemorate a sculpture and small park in honor of the workers who perished.

For their part, Aenebra has not officially claimed any credit for the attack. Evidence from the investigation links a known Aenebra member with a false identity sneaking aboard the space elevator to commit their heinous crime. Footage shows the operative assembling a makeshift bomb using various pieces of equipment on the Gamma lift, including items from a freight box which was not registered in the original shipment itinerary. This has led some to suspect that this may have been a multiple-man operation, but investigators have not released further details.

Shipping Lane Disruptions Across Black Rise, Placid, and Syndicate Cause Concern
Koren Akko • YC124.07.21

Onnamon, Black Rise - Independent couriers operating across the regions of Black Rise, Placid, and Syndicate have all been reporting disruptions and delays to shipments across each region, respectively, last Thursday. The incidents were thought to be isolated occurrences from one another, until CONCORD’s AEGIS division issued a low level traffic advisory for the regions until further notice. Despite the rather mundane and vague nature of the advisory, it has been a cause for concern for numerous inhabitants and visitors of the affected regions.

Prominent observers have noted the similarities between these chain of events and those of four years ago under the code name Case Green Magic in such regions as Derelik and Molden Heath. However, AEGIS has been quick to assure the public that these were minor incidents and have not been linked to one another as of yet. The assurance seems to have done little to assuage local retailers, couriers, and the public itself.

“Fukiye Interstellar will be suspending shipping operations for the time being”, stated a press release from the shipping company, released a day after the incidents. “While the traffic advisory for the region of Black Rise is minor, we take the utmost caution in protecting the lives of our employees. Our shipping operations in the adjacent regions of The Forge and The Citadel will continue, however. We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause.”

Other shipping companies in the regions have also considered suspending operations for the time being, or simply hiring armed escorts for their transports. InterBus, for example, is expected to stack their shipping transport schedules closer together and use armed escorts. Some retailers have already temporarily removed shipping options for those regions, or warn about the potential delays.

In the meantime, complaint filings related to shipping delays have marginally increased for the local offices of various retail chains that operate in the regions - much to the ire of customer service reps of those companies.

Syndicate Fashionista Icon Stirs Controversy Once Again on Social Media
Taigeru Beldeia • YC124.07.20

Poitot, Syndicate - Enigmatic and eccentric Haus Porteau founder, Rudy “Roo” Porteau, has once again caused a stir on various social media platforms for his remarks about top rival, Fabuleux. Fabuleux, who has retired his capsuleer license and has been living as a non-capsuleer for a number of years now, did not make his presence known during the opening fashion walk of the Summer of Fashion tour. Porteau’s comment on the Peeper™ app suggests how Fabuleux has lost his charm, and will soon wither away by the end of the summer if things don’t change fast for the troubled fashion designer.

Fabuleux, who still maintains a sizable following of loyal fans, has not publicly responded to Porteau’s taunts, but his fanbase certainly has. “Rudy ‘Runt’ Porteau is nothing more than an ego-driven fashion bully. He will never understand the horrors that Fabuleaux went thru when he was kidnapped by crazy people! Leave Fabuleaux ALONE!”, peeped one dedicated Fabuleux fan, FabLyf.

Porteau and Fabuleux have a long-storied history of personal rivalry, which extends to the fashion brands each one operates. The origin of their rivalry is still not fully understood, but some suspect it was the result of a failed-love-story-turned-sour. Such rumors have never been confirmed by either Porteau or Fabuleux, however. Another prevailing theory hypothesizes that the two are former brothers who never got along.

While Porteau has not deleted his peep on Peeper™, even his own fanbase has mixed feelings about the brutality of his comments against Fabuleux. He has lost some 100,000 followers on Peeper™ alone, not including various other social media platforms which also experienced some losses. I-RCN has attempted to reach out to the publicists for both Fabuleux and Porteau but has not received word back.

BREAKING: Pole Dancers Has Quit Gallente Militia
Koren Akko • YC124.08.10

Harroule, Placid - We have just received reports that The Pole Dancers [POLE], who have been at war with I-RED for the last few weeks, has quit the Gallente militia. We have reached out to FDU representatives for comment but have not received word back. POLE and their allies have been engaged in numerous battles against I-RED and the other members of Syndicate Coalition, with POLE and their allies scoring a number of strategic wins in the form of destroyed Upwell facilities belonging to SynCo. However, SynCo often triumphed when it came to fleet battles.

Some analysts are suggesting that POLE quitting Gallente militia is their way out of this complicated affair against SynCo forces. Others are saying it is still too early to claim victory for SynCo. I-RCN will continue to monitor updates on the situation. Regardless of the outcome, I-RCN would like to take a moment to remind our viewers that Syndicate Steel is unbreakable.

Aenebra Cult Ramps Up Attacks in Solitude & Raids Aridia
Selenna Solange • YC124.08.08

Ogaria, Solitude - The infamous death cult has continued to ramp up operations across Placid, Syndicate, and Solitude in recent months. Only recently the Aenebra Cult have conducted a series of attacks against I-RED in Syndicate. Earlier today, they concluded what is now the third attack in southern Solitude. The attack today occurred on Ogaria II, and left hundreds wounded and dozens dead.

“For whatever reason, Aenebra have become emboldened in the last several months”, said Jufrit Valliers, a Gallente Police Directorate (GPD) spokesman. “We have been tracking their movements and have observed an increase in activity across a number of regions. It remains unclear how they are funding their operations both in terms of manpower and assets.”

The attack in Ogaria was carried out by a dummy transport loaded with explosives and then sent planetside to a major starport on the surface. Ogarians were shocked that such an event rocked their relatively quiet world. Many took to social media to voice their concerns and mourn.

“The local government failed us. The Federation failed us. The GPD failed us. Is this what Aguard had in mind when she became president? Disappointing”, peeped a local Ogaria II business owner on the social media platform Peeper™.

In another peep, which has garnered thousands of repeeps, a mother who lost her husband and child in the attack said, “Words cannot describe the emptiness I feel right now. Aenebra is just one of many problems which have been on the rise around these parts. The Federation needs to do better. I know we can do better.”

It has been noted that I-RED has recently engaged in information sharing with the GPD with regards to dealing with the Aenebra Cult. Curiously, it seems that Aenebra has also been expanding their operations into Aridia, which could spell trouble for the local Amarr defense forces in the region. I-RCN will monitor the situation as developments come.

Foundation Week Celebrations Conclude in Syndicate With Ceremony of Cooperation
Jelvia Taredi • YC124.08.09

XS-XAY, Syndicate - The end of Foundation Day celebrations concluded recently, and a final ceremony dedicated to allyship between SynCo members Khimi Harar [LUMEN] and I-RED was held aboard the LUMEN Cathedral of Syndicate in XS-XAY. Both capsuleers and non-capsuleers gathered to celebrate the strong relations between both organizations, which stand as a testament to the power of mutual goals and shared understanding between two cultures.

“A notable portion of temporary and permanent residents residing in I-RAT structures are of current and former Amarr citizenry”, stated Department of Public Works Director Roirdan Bouchate. “We take great pride here at I-RED at the fair practice of religion outlined in our corporate religious practice charter. The diversity of culture and cultural understanding is key to a powerful and productive workforce. These ideas will continue to carry our pocket of space in Syndicate into a prosperous future.”

Notable speakers at the ceremony included members from LUMEN leadership such as Directrix Lunarisse Aspenstar, as well as members from the I-RED Board of Directors. In a particularly impassioned speech, I-RED Executor Alex Hinkelmann highlighted how cooperation between all members of SynCo (I-RED, LUMEN, and I-BLU) are key to the strategic goals of turning Syndicate into a significant powerhouse. A powerful Intaki Syndicate means a powerful ally for both the Caldari State and Amarr Empire, claimed Executor Hinkelmann.

Food catering for the event featured an assortment of Caldari-Amarr fusion food cultivated locally by various astro-farms. The Yak cheese food products which included such items as gourmet macaroni, gourmet cheese pizza, and gourmet pasta were said to be the highlight of the food provided. Music for the ceremony included both an Amarrian orchestral choir joined by a traditional Raata ensemble.

The future remains bright for the residents of Syndicate, and I-RED and LUMEN aim to be leaders in the charge for a prosperous tomorrow.

Mounting Criticism Regarding I-RED Imposed Customs Taxes Across 98Q Superpocket
Koren Akko • YC124.08.10

98Q-8O, Syndicate - In recent weeks, there has been growing vocalization about the tax rate for planetary customs issued by offices owned or managed by proxy via I-RED. This is likely due to the recently concluded war versus various combined former Gallente militia and pirate forces in the region. SynCo members suffered losses of numerous Upwell structures, although many of the fleet battles were considerably in favor of SynCo forces.

“It is likely the losses of Upwell structures by SynCo forces has triggered the rise of criticism against its members in their management of facilities across the JQV5-9 and MK7-AO constellations”, commented one analyst from I-RED’s Department of Public Works. “It is an expected reaction amongst some individuals, unfortunately. However, the facts remain that the taxes imposed on SynCo-managed customs offices are among the lowest in the region.”

The general attitude by I-RED management seems to be that of dismissing the ill-informed remarks by those who are critical of the 3.2% customs tax across the majority of customs offices. Revenue generated by customs taxes goes into a large pool of funds which are then divided into various categories such as I-RED Enforcer fleet maintenance, local infrastructure developments and maintenance, and local charity work.

BREAKING: I-RED Assets Seized Across Intaki Prime
Selenna Solange • YC124.11.09

Intaki, Placid - Following the massive Federation invasion of Intaki and surrounding systems, I-RED has found itself in a tough situation with regards to its planetary holdings on Intaki Prime. A number of facilities have been swarmed and overwhelmed by the Federation forces; these assets have been temporarily seized by the Federation military, with personnel being arrested.

There are still many other facilities which have yet to fall to the encroaching Federation forces. For some others, their status is not yet known because of ongoing communication disruptions to planetside dwellers.

I-RED operates many different types of facilities all across Intaki Prime, from resource harvesting outposts to warehouses to manufacturing plants to even public service infrastructure. In an interesting twist, a number of railgun emplacements which were leased to the Intaki Assembly militia forces by I-RED following the Lai Dai Protection Service raids on Intaki some years ago were also seized by the Federation Armed Forces. Some turrets were outright targeted and destroyed during the initial waves of invasion. It is not known at this time if the Federation military was aware that these gun batteries were being operated by the Intaki.

Despite the ongoing communications disruptions, I-RED is doing what they can to update personnel across all the remaining facilities on the planet. I-RED personnel are being ordered to stand down and abandon the facilities. Furthermore, I-RED is working in conjunction with Caldari State military forces to re-establish uninterrupted communications in order to ensure everyone is informed of the most current status of the ongoing situation.

BREAKING: I-RED Directorship Hosts Emergency Meeting Regarding Viriette Operations
Selenna Solange • YC124.11.08

VV-VCR, Syndicate - Shortly after the primary diplomat of I-RED, Julianni Avala, released an official press release regarding the invasion of Intaki by the Gallente Federation, the Directorship of I-RED convened in an emergency session. The primary topic of discussion was, of course, how to respond to the massive Federation Navy assault in Viriette and Fislipesnes. Details were not immediately made available to the general public, but the following brief statement was made.

“The Directorship is aware of the ongoing chaotic situation in Intaki and the adjacent systems. A massive communications disruption across multiple systems is making it particularly difficult to maintain contact with personnel on the ground. Actions are in motion and I-RED is mobilizing the full force of our reserve fleets for immediate future operations. More details will follow in the coming days.”

The exact nature of the future operations have not been detailed. However, observers will note a massive mobilization of reserve fleets across the 98Q Superpocket in Syndicate. I-RED capitals and jump freighters have also been seen increasingly. Meanwhile, mandatory orders of activation of military service have been enacted for registered reserve forces under I-RED.

BREAKING: Ongoing Communication Disruption Contributes to Death Count
Koren Akko • YC124.11.09

Intaki, Placid - As part of the Federation’s invasion, communications with planetside assets have been disrupted. The resulting disruption has proven to be useful to the Federation military in some ways, but detrimental in others. On one hand, it has allowed the Federation the element of surprise in many instances, with many Caldari State personnel being completely unaware of what was going on and unable to react in a prompt manner. On the other hand, they have also contributed to a growing death count as Caldari State personnel who catch wind of what is going on assume their orders are to engage the Federation forces.

Precisely this has occurred in a number of I-RED-managed facilities across Intaki Prime. Some outposts engaged the invading Federation armed forces despite being massively outnumbered. Reports are still unconfirmed at this time, but it is believed that some other I-RED security forces - bolstered by remnants of Caldari State militia forces - have begun guerrilla warfare against the occupying Federation armed forces. These operations currently run contrary to what has been officially ordered by the I-RED Directorship, but continued difficulties with establishing secure communications have contributed to a delay in the orders getting out to stand down and retreat.

In one particularly tragic event, a fortification far in the outskirts of Navyii Akat was besieged by Federation forces. The Federation managed to push the defending State forces into a nearby Intaki town where casualties mounted not only of Federation and State forces, but of local Intaki civilians. A cease-fire in the town has since been established, and a Sisters of Eve relief taskforce has reportedly managed to deploy to the area to provide assistance.

Communications Disruptions from Initial Federation Invasion Restored
Selenna Solange • YC124.11.16

Intaki, Placid - The communications disruptions which were caused by a sophisticated Federation military apparatus have mostly been restored thanks to a concerted effort by the Ishukone-Raata Engineering Corps (I-REC). A specialized I-REC taskforce was covertly deployed to Intaki and surrounding systems promptly following the initial Federation invasion. The I-RED Directorship deemed the restoration of reliable communications to be paramount to establishing a united understanding among forces spread throughout Viriette planetside fronts.

“I-REC quickly got to work figuring out how to bypass comms relays under interference from an advanced Federation communications malware which served to sow chaos in State ranks throughout Viriette”, stated I-REC Placid Senior Engineer Tappio Onikerasu. “Thanks to some newfound knowledge gained by acquiring Hyasyoda-subsidiary Saitsuo Interstellar Security, our teams were able to configure reliable communications links which could not be disrupted by the Fed malware using some rather ingenious concealment methods…which I obviously won’t go into detail here.”

I-RED has afforded use of this technology to State forces operating in Viriette. There has also been a request for use of the technology by civilian networks which were inadvertently affected by the Federation disruptions. However, the Federation denies involvement in the ongoing disruptions. The disruptions themselves seem to be slowly wearing away as the days go on.

Massive Withdrawal Operations Well Underway for I-RED In and Around Intaki
Koren Akko • YC124.11.17

Agoze, Placid - I-RED command have recently announced a full withdrawal of all military assets in and around Intaki. However, evacuation efforts have already been well underway for the last few days. Spearheading these efforts before they even became official was Vice-Admiral Korbin Lavius. It has been alleged that Vice-Admiral Lavius began prompt demilitarization initiatives without the express consent of the I-RED Directorship. Local news agencies have documentation of seeing an I-RED Chimera-class carrier by the callsign IRV Shirozen-Haitaku in and around Intaki. I-RCN is currently unable to verify the legitimacy of such evidence.

I-RCN has attempted to reach out to Vice-Admiral Lavius but he has turned down a request for comment at this time, citing only the following, “the most necessary actions do not always require a necessary order.”

Federation military forces at this time appear to have an understanding with local I-RED forces and are allowing a retreat. Federation-controlled gun batteries on Intaki Prime, for example, have allowed the passage of transport-only ships to and from the surface of Intaki Prime.

Meanwhile, however, some critics are already raising concern about the potential legal ramifications of I-RED engaging in demilitarization operations and diplomatic talks with the Federation military in Viriette. There exists concern about the legality of I-RED, a Caldari militia member, engaging in ceasefire arrangements with the Federation in Viriette. Other critics argue that I-RED is giving up far too easily and simply should not acquiesce to the Federation occupation of formally Caldari-held Intaki. A formal response by the I-RED Directorship to these criticisms is not currently available.

It is expected that by the end of today, over half of I-RED major military assets in and around Intaki will have been successfully evacuated. There is still much work that remains to be done in the coming days. It is also still unclear what will become of non-military assets that I-RED either owns or leases to local governments, such as hospitals, office buildings, power plants, and other facilities.

Combat Engagements Between I-RED and Federation Military in Viriette Mostly Ceased
Selenna Solange • YC124.11.17

Intaki, Placid - Combat engagements between I-RED forces throughout Viriette and the Federation military have slowly been decreasing over the last few days. The decline in combat between the two sides is largely attributed to a restoration of reliable communications between I-RED command and subordinate forces thanks to the tireless work of the Ishukone-Raata Engineering Corps. Still, as of today there are still some engagements that have happened as a result of misunderstandings between the two sides, mostly.

Another potential cause is the heavy use of one of I-RED’s primary security contractors, the Oniseki-Raata Internal Watch (O-RIW). O-RIW has a notorious history of utilizing brute force tactics when dealing with contracted issues; however, their proven track record in accomplishing tasks in efficient time frames has earned them high regards when it comes to securing security contracts issued by I-RED and other entities. I-RED Executor Alex Hinkelmann has demonstrated a preference for utilizing O-RIW to accomplish specific tasks. O-RIW was recently deployed in force over the weekend to Intaki and adjacent systems, where they scrambled to remove significant items of importance from potential harm’s way. In working to achieve these goals, many of the engagements over the weekend between I-RED and the Federation military have been specifically between O-RIW and the Federation military.

Losses on both sides have been fairly minimal, and O-RIW is reporting a high success rate in achieving their duties assigned to them directly by Executor Hinkelmann himself. With the most recent press release by alliance lead diplomat Julianni Avala, I-RED’s other significant security contractor, the Revenent Defence Corporation (RDC), has also deployed en masse to Viriette in order to assist in diplomatic negotiations and evacuation and relocation operations. While official orders have been given for all I-RED forces to refrain from engaging in combat with the Federation military, there was specific space allowed for engagement under absolutely necessary circumstances. So far, further bloodshed on both sides has been avoided ever since the official cease fire order from I-RED Directorship.

I-RED Continues Collaboration With Caldari State Colonization Effort in Syndicate
Selenna Solange • YC124.12.25

QWF-6P, Syndicate - It has been just over a month now since the Caldari State was invited to gain control of the DS-M4Q constellation of eastern Syndicate. The State wasted no time in moving a massive amount of military forces into the area alongside many construction projects going on in space across the various systems of the sizable area. The move was welcomed by many in the Caldari State, but perhaps none so eager as the Ishuk-Raata Enforcement Directive.

I-RED has been living and working in Syndicate for the better part of the last decade, working to forge stronger connections between the State and the Syndicate. I-RED along with their notable allies who make up the Syndicate Coalition [SynCo], the Intaki-Business Logistics Union [I-BLU] and Khimi Harar [LUMEN], together have built a haven for international cooperation in the 98Q “superpocket” - a large pocket in southern Syndicate consisting of the JVQ5-9 and MK7-AO constellations. As a direct result of their efforts, SynCo has significantly enhanced the economic, sociocultural, and political richness of the 98Q superpocket.

“The negotiations made between officials of the Intaki Syndicate and Caldari State are something we have been working towards for…many years”, stated I-RED Executor Alex Hinkelmann in a press conference. “We are relieved to finally have such a strong backing from the Caldari State as a whole, rather than the select few Caldari megacorporations which chose to operate in the area. My team and I have been hard at work drafting plans to continue our mission in Syndicate, along with supporting the burgeoning State colonization effort in DS-M4Q. I look forward to sharing plans with you all soon.”

While the Executor remained tight-lipped about potential grand schemes, observant media has noted a large increase in private meetings between SynCo officials and an unknown group of individuals. However, some of those individuals were later identified as members belonging to OceanLink Orbital Ventures, a relatively new startup company with a focus in orbital infrastructure projects.

Meanwhile, there has been an increase in jump freighter traffic to and from the Syndicate region by I-RED. Weekly runs have been conducted in Rhea-class jump freighters, and I-RED officials have admitted that they are stockpiling a large inventory of construction materials. Various I-RED subsidiary corporations have also been quickly setting up offices in DS-M4Q to support the State colonization efforts. For example, Myoka Galactic™ has already opened up two dealerships in the constellation, and has an ongoing sale of planetary vehicles at a discount for active duty State military personnel. The prominent transport company Syndicate Company Tours™ has also opened up numerous branch offices across the constellation; a promotional offer which is expected to continue well into the new year offers a significant discount for ferrying of family members of active duty State military personnel to and from Caldari territory in high-security space to Syndicate.

Investor Talks Increase Between I-RED and OceanLink Orbital Ventures
Koren Akko • YC124.12.24

Hatakani, The Citadel - Enigmatic and relatively unknown executive, Vitakka Tuomai, CEO of OceanLink Orbital Ventures and now alliance head of the newly formed Hatakani Trade Winds Combine [HAT] has managed to forge strong connections with members of the Syndicate Coalition. Tuomai has been frequently seen engaging in public meetings in and around Hatakani, which is the stronghold for the TNR Combine - a powerful alliance between the Ishukone, Hyasyoda, and Wiyrkomi megacorporations.

While many meeting details between SynCo executives and Tuomai have not been disclosed to the public, it has been noted that I-RED has engaged in investor talks with OceanLink. As part of rounding out its extensive portfolio, I-RED has long been considering investments in entities not aligned in the current CEMWPA conflict, as such investments would provide unique opportunities not available to I-RED directly due to its involvement as a member of the Caldari State Protectorate.

Already it has been noted that OceanLink Orbital Ventures has purchased numerous assets from I-RED thus far, including a sizable number of planetary customs offices. It is expected these buyouts will continue, although what more may come from any potential business ventures between I-RED and HAT remains to be seen.

Suroken National Cryonics on Slow Road to Recovery
Koren Akko • YC124.12.23

Intaki, Placid - Following the massive invasion of Intaki by the Federation Armed Forces, SNC has found itself on a near-breaking point. At one point towards the end of last month, they were on the verge of insolvency, with a majority of their personnel and facilities across the system being apprehended by the Federation forces. However, thanks to ongoing negotiations between I-RED and the local Federation forces, SNC personnel have been released - the final group of detainees were evacuated early last week.

Now, with most of their skilled personnel back to safety, SNC can look at the long road ahead of restructuring and rebuilding. The company still took massive losses with most of their infrastructure being destroyed or seized and sold off by occupying Federation forces. Talks are rumored to be in the works of the company relocating its primary operations to Syndicate, where there already exists a strong array of businesses invested in the cloning market.

“Cryoprotectant solutions are always in demand, as most major capsuleer organizations and empire militaries make heavy use of cloning technologies for their personnel”, noted one economic analyst. “Cryoprotectant production remains rather niche, with only a relatively small number of companies across the cluster producing it. SNC would do well to move their operations to Syndicate, which is a region of space which historically has been very open to…various types of business ventures - legal and not-so-legal. Furthermore, I’m sure they would enjoy the support from their allies in I-RED and now the Caldari State who controls DS-M4Q.”

SNC is expected to make official announcements regarding their future operations within the coming weeks, following the holiday season.

BREAKING: Oicx Frontline Falls to Caldari Counter Attack
Koren Akko - YC125.01.06

Capture

Oicx, Placid - After several months of conflict, the Gallente held frontline system Oicx saw its defences collapse late this evening. So far, the data collected from the siege over infrastructure in the system reveals a loss of assets ranging somewhere around fifteen billion isk, largely belonging to Protectorate forces. The capture of this strategic system further places Federal forces in the Vlillirier system, effectively on the frontlines, a key Federal stronghold that Gallente forces have used to initiate failed attempts to push into Caldari territory.

Meanwhile, there are reports of a complete collapse of Federation frontlines all across the warzone, and there is speculation that many of the Gallente gains will be reversed within the next three days to a week. This comes just weeks after several uncontested gains by Federal Defense forces in the Citadel and Black Rise.

I-RCN will continue to report on this as the situation develops.

I-RED Completes Divestment of Assets in Intaki
Selenna Solange • YC125.02.03

Intaki, Placid - With the final agreements secured, the TNR Colonial Monitoring Facility (Astrahus-class Citadel) over Intaki Prime has finally been relinquished. I-RED sold it as part of an ongoing acquisition process of numerous assets to the newly formed Hatakani Trade Winds Combine [HAT]. While still much is unknown publicly about HAT, the I-RED Board of Directors seem content with the ongoing relations between the two entities, and display the utmost trust in the economic prowess of HAT executives.

“The handing over of the last of I-RED assets in Intaki signifies an important message”, commented I-RED Director of Public Works Roirdan Bouchate. “It signifies that there is a brighter horizon for the people of Intaki. While I am unable to disclose full details, I can say that HAT intends to operate on the principles of free trade and mutual benefit which the TNR Combine already operates under. We look forward to continuing business relations with HAT, and wish them success in their economic ventures in Intaki and beyond.”

The timing of these events comes as I-RED has extended territorial claims to numerous systems in Providence in support of CVA’s campaign to reacquire the region. Public details about the reasoning for I-RED’s operations in Providence are scarce, but political experts theorize it is purely to provide administrative support to CVA and their allies, rather than any serious attempt by I-RED to colonize and develop Providence.

Significant Spike in SynCo Jump Freighter Traffic to Syndicate Leads to Speculation
Koren Akko • YC125.02.02

XS-XAY, Syndicate - The glistening gunmetal grey hull of the Rhea-class jump freighter IRV Vaurauden Henki reflects the lights of the bright hologram which proudly displays the I-RED logo over the Reppola Logistics Port. The “Henki” is just one of many jump freighters seen making frequent trips to and from the 98Q superpocket in Syndicate. Aboard the I-RED Astrahus and the neighboring LUMEN Astrahus, scores of teams neatly unload and reorganize significant quantities of goods - prefab units, auto-assemblers, construction blocks, and more.

The workers themselves seem unaware of the purpose of all that equipment. Directorship from both LUMEN and I-RED are hush-lipped about the purpose of so much construction materials. This has led to quite the speculation by outsiders.

One theory is that the Syndicate Coalition [SynCo], made up of LUMEN, I-RED, and I-BLU, will attempt to re-establish a Fortizar-class Citadel in the 98Q superpocket. There is some doubt cast upon this idea, however, since the area is under the watchful eyes of pirate capsuleer entities with significant force projection of supercapital assets.

Another leading theory is that the materials will be used to help construct various fortifications of facilities in the 98Q superpocket, as well as to aid in fortifying State colonial assets in DS-M4Q. This is certainly plausible since the recent announcement by the Federation Navy to establish their new headquarters in Intaki has led to quiet concern among those in Syndicate.

Still, another possible theory is that SynCo is planning on starting a joint colonial project on one of the worlds in the 98Q superpocket. This theory follows the breadcrumbs of previous clues which all point to a joint colonial effort by the three members of SynCo. Where such a colony would develop is hotly contested. After all, I-RED has already spearheaded the development of the first public colony in Syndicate - the Utpattia Protectorate in A-3ES3.

Time will tell which of the aforementioned speculations turn out to be true. How much time is anyone’s guess.

End of Western Regions Winter Fashion Week Marked With Drama and Flair
Taigeru Beldeia • YC125.02.03

Serpentis Prime, Fountain - Today marks the end of the Western Regions Winter Fashion Week. It was a week marked with surprises and upsets, but perhaps most notable was how it started and how it ended.

The start of the fashion week was a performance put on by this year’s show director Monsieur Blonc, an enigmatic fashion mogul who hails from Essence. Blonc, who has been in the fashion industry now for over forty years, decided to use recent events to completely change the fashion week’s opening performance at the last minute. Rather than stick with his original idea, he trashed it all and changed it to feature a story of unity and cooperation between the Caldari State and Intaki Syndicate. This left the performers and team with only a couple months to scramble together a performance and rehearse. To cause further drama to this debacle, there are ongoing allegations that Blonc changed the performance at the behest of an under-the-table transaction that occurred between him and Intaki Bank agents. These allegations have not been confirmed.

“Blonc has a venerable history of sparking new waves in the fashion industry and society”, peeped one Peeper™ user, Fashion_Diva_Duh. The user is a widely-followed fashion critic and news relayer. “The allegations made against him are simply from those rival fashion houses who cannot tolerate seeing the man succeed. Empty words from empty people. Nothing more!”

The decision has caused numerous boycotts of Blonc Haus fashion stores in the Gallente Federation, most notably in the Crux constellation. While no property damage from boycotters has been reported thus far, Blonc Haus is taking no chances and has opted to hire additional security temporarily while the wave of anger crashes over.

Meanwhile, competition was fierce between fashion houses in Placid and Solitude. Traditionally, these two regions have always seen intense competition at major fashion shows, but this year it was particularly intense. Chances are high that it is related to all the recent events which have rocked Placid - notably, the invasion of Viriette and Fislipesnes by the Gallente Federation.

The show ended with fashion mogul Rudy “Roo” Porteau stealing the spotlight in the walk segment which featured all the fashion house participants. Porteau descended from the ceiling with special-made grav boosters which dispersed a cloud of crystalline compounds. Porteau was dressed in an ornate winter coat bedazzled with emerald and sapphire crystals. He performed an elaborate interpretive dance routine as the glittering crystalline compounds rained around him. The spectacle, while captivating, caused outrage from numerous fashion house heads. Porteau ended the routine by announcing his Glittering Glam winter collection. The announcement was met with mixed boos and applause by the audience.

This year’s Wester Regions Winter Fashion week is sure to be one for the books.

SynCo freighters with carrier escort commencing landing operations on XS-XAY IV
XS-XAY, Syndicate - In a joint press conference with leadership representatives from each of the Syndicate Coalition [SynCo] alliance members (I-RED, I-BLU, LUMEN), a colonial megaproject and market initiative were announced. SynCo has been storing and organizing materials in recent weeks in preparation of the official launch of the XS-XAY IV colonial project. It was confirmed in the press conference that talks of a joint SynCo colonial project had been going on for over a year. XS-XAY IV was chosen for a variety of reasons, including the fact that the system serves as the administrative headquarters for I-RED and LUMEN in Syndicate. Additionally, XS-XAY is centrally located in the 98Q “superpocket”, and it hosts the planet with the most ideal conditions for human settlement out of any terrestrial world in the 98Q superpocket.

“It is my immense pleasure on behalf of the I-RED Board of Directors, alongside leadership from Intaki-Business Logistics Union and Khimi Harar, to announce the christening of the joint SynCo colonial project - San Mendinaeya”, announced I-RED Director of Public Works Roirdan Bouchate. “This project is done as a collaborative effort between our respective organizations, as well as the independent colony which has opted to go along with the adoption by SynCo. I would also like to extend my thanks to the team at LUMEN who took a leading role in negotiating an agreement with the existing independent colony representatives. This project would not be possible without their skillful diplomatic negotiations.”

San Mendinaeya will refer to the capital city of the SynCo colony project on XS-XAY IV. It is a name which is a mesh of the original colony name as well as Intaki and Amarr influences. The colony that has agreed to be adopted by SynCo is a former participant of I-RED’s Project Dustbowl led by the infamous Katrina Oniseki in YC113. Records show that this colony was one of the four colonies out of a total of twenty-three participating colonies in the project to receive surplus funding from Project Dustbowl. In addition to the core required infrastructure markers for the project, which included (among other things) a starport, hospital, water treatment and distribution plant, aneutronic fusion power plant, and a fluid router switch and relay station, this colony also was able to construct an education center, hydroponics farm, and places of worship for both Amarr and Intaki religions.

The official colony name has yet to be decided, but for now all territory belonging to the colony will be referred to as San Mendinaeya. The colony is situated in the equatorial region of the planet, on a land bridge which separates two vast inland lakes to the north and south. To the east is an area of the continent which is blanketed in a sprawling tropical rainforest. Westerly winds from the northern and southern hemispheres bring moisture-rich air inland where the weather systems are greeted and stopped by mountain ranges to the west of San Mendinaeya. The lowest lying basins have thus been flooded over time with a tremendous amount of freshwater being fed by both excess rain from the tropical rainforest and meltwater from the mountains.

LUMEN Directrix Lunarisse Aspenstar had this to say, “LUMEN naturally will be providing humanitarian supplies generally, as well as a detachment of clerical neophytes to provide spiritual succor to any Amarr expatriates in the colony.”

SynCo colonial planners are working with the existing colony representatives on how to best continue growing and developing the city. Right now, crews are at work making improvements to the colonial starport, and setting the foundation for an eventual space elevator system to be constructed. Improvements to the various seaports in the northern and southern edges of the city are also being made, as well as automation enhancements to the existing farmlands on the outskirts of the colony.

Jump freighters from each of the signatory SynCo members were escorted by a Chimera-class carrier to the planet to commence landing operations for construction materials, equipment, and personnel. It was a smooth process which transpired over several hours without incident.

The establishment of this colony project marks it as the second publicly announced colonial project in the region of Syndicate - the first being the colony of the Utpattia Protectorate established by I-RED in the system of A-3ES3. The timing of this development comes as tensions between the Intaki Syndicate and neighboring Gallente Federation rise following the Federation takeover of Intaki. The events of which have caused a mass exodus of people from Placid into neighboring regions. SynCo infrastructure is at a critical capacity as space onboard citadel structures is extremely limited right now. Prices for residences across all SynCo structures is reported at an all time high, posing a housing crisis. Space aboard stations across Syndicate are not faring much better. The new colony in XS-XAY offers a much needed opportunity for stations across the region to offload their excess populations.

I-RCN will continue to monitor and report on San Mendinaeya colonial developments.

SynCo Announces New Market Initiative in Kandashi Station
Koren Akko • YC125.03.17

M2-CF1, Syndicate - In a joint press conference with leadership representatives from each of the Syndicate Coalition [SynCo] alliance members (I-RED, I-BLU, LUMEN), a colonial megaproject and market initiative were announced. Deliberations on where to establish a more permanent market presence were reportedly ongoing for weeks. Ultimately, the location of Kandashi Station, more commonly known as M2-CF1 X-3 Intaki Syndicate Bureau, won out. Other contested picks included DP34-U and S-U.

“The choice to consolidate separate, individual market initiatives into one official project just makes sense”, commented I-RED Director of Public Works Roirdan Bouchate. “The combined efforts of all three alliances [of SynCo] have much greater chances of sustaining a market with plenty of goods to purchase at competitive rates.”

The choice for M2-CF1 won for a variety of reasons. M2-CF1 has historical significance in the region of Syndicate, as it was an important launch point for colonial and exploration efforts into many adjacent pockets of systems. Today the system still plays an important role as it is a key waypoint for many travelers, both immigrants and emigrants and of course visitors. The central location thus plays a pivotal role in it functioning as a top candidate for establishing a dedicated market initiative.

The Kandashi family, who has maintained leadership on board the station for generations, seems to be welcoming of the project. The family has long advocated for Intaki Syndicate autonomy, and are fierce defenders of Syndicate independence; they make significant contributions to the Intaki Space Police annually. A spokesperson for the family stated that, “I-RED along with their allies of I-BLU and LUMEN have long shown a concerted interest in developing Syndicate alongside Intaki. The Kandashi family looks forward to more opportunities to build a stronger Syndicate.”

Kandashi Station in M2-CF1
SynCo is currently working on formalizing security agreements with the Kandashi family in regards to providing security services in order to protect the free trade nature of the station. It is expected that the negotiations will conclude by the end of the coming week, and that SynCo will engage any pirate forces who attempt to raid or blockade the station.

Intense Fighting in Battle for Deven Continues
Koren Akko • YC125.03.15

Deven, Essence - Caldari militia forces have managed to regain control of systems lost during an aggressive push by Gallente militia forces into The Citadel. Now Federal Defence Union pilots are on the defensive as State Protectorate forces make a push to break into Essence. Daily losses on both sides of the conflict continue to mount as the State Protectorate forces seek to establish a foothold in the system.

I-RED has been primarily focused on the western front of the warzone, working hard alongside other State Protectorate pilots to secure systems in The Citadel. Only recently did I-RED command officially pull its staging operations from the Hasmijaala/Hysera systems closer to the frontline in Deven. I-RED reports little to no involvement on the eastern front of the warzone, where State Protectorate forces have completely stormed the Pegeler constellation and are overtaking systems at a rapid pace.

Fighting in Deven has attracted the attention of various pirate and independently-aligned capsuleers as well. Groups such as Snuffed Out have taken a keen interest in ambushing various militia targets of opportunity, such as tech one cruisers and the like, using Black Ops and other covert operations vessels. In a recent engagement, Caldari and Gallente militia forces found themselves temporarily aligned as Snuffed Out ambushed a contingent of cruisers on the Fliet gate in Deven. Daring pilots on both sides of the militia made runs in command destroyers to split the Snuffed Out forces up away from their force auxiliary capital support (FAX). Snuffed Out ultimately ended up bridging in a total of six Apostle-class FAX. However, despite the support of the FAX on field, Snuffed Out did end up losing multiple Black Ops battleships as well as a Vargur-class Marauder in a prolonged engagement versus an assortment of tech one cruisers, destroyers, and frigates.

I-RCN has received unconfirmed reports that following the engagement, the Snuffed Out pilots who lost ships filed recovery claims with the Secure Commerce Commission. There has since been unsubstantiated rumors that the recovery claims were granted by the SCC, and the losses of the ships in question were refunded in full. The rumors have generated much guffaw among the militia baseliner ranks, as the mighty Snuffed Out was toppled easily by an assortment of cruisers, destroyers, and frigates.

For now, however, the battle for Deven rages on.

XS-XAY, Syndicate - Further divestment of Ishukone-Raata assets within the Intaki Syndicate have been announced during the organizations annual Development Investment Review Panel. Details on the agreement as a whole is still unknown, however sources indicate that many of the orbital assets outside of systems where the Ishukone Corporation is involved have been purchased wholesale by the Hatakani Trade Winds Combine.

It has been confirmed anonymously by members of the Hatakani Trade Winds Combine that the Ishukone-Raata Corporate Investment Bank and CHTAR Trust gained a sizable share within the main investing corporation, OceanLink Orbital Ventures. It is suspected that the entire takeover of the assets in the region is somewhere around 90,000,000,000.00 ISK in value.

So far the reasoning for the sale hasn’t been clear, however speculation from outside observers point to the recent internal events within the Caldari State.

SynCo Commissions New Logo & Branding Campaign

Selenna Solange • YC125.05.24

XS-XAY, Syndicate - The Syndicate Coalition, comprised of the capsuleer alliances of Intaki-Business Logistics Union [I-BLU], Ishuk-Raata Enforcement Directive [I-RED], and Khimi Harar [LUMEN], has issued a unified branding campaign. While SynCo is a name that has collectively referred to different alliances during the more than decade-long span of time I-RED has operated in Syndicate, this most current iteration of SynCo has existed now for a little over three years. This version of SynCo has also seen drastically more cooperation and unity in terms of political, financial, and social fronts. Thus, the SynCo leadership has deemed it appropriate to commission an official branding campaign.

The result of the current branding campaign has yielded the official logo above. In the end, a design idea put forth by I-RED’s esteemed financial director, Julianni Avala, won out of the designs submitted. The orange-yellow flare of the star behind the “planet” emulates the orange hue of the sun at the center of the XS-XAY system - long deemed the capital system of SynCo. The formal treaty which united the three members of SynCo was drafted and signed in XS-XAY.

In an official unveiling of a formal SynCo logo to be used in various branding, SynCo officials released the following joint statement, “Three years ago a project grounded in trust, unity, and shared governance was started. It was an ambitious leap of faith - a bet that three groups of people from very different backgrounds could come together and collaborate to build each other up, and to build the area they share in prosperity. There have been trying times already, and there will certainly be trying times ahead, but through it all we all remain SynCo strong.”

The logo and other branding paraphernalia have begun making their way across a whole host of assets belonging to SynCo. Thus far, it seems like a strong tool to encourage more brand recognition and respect for the alliances of SynCo.

Hatakani Trade Winds Combine Officially Joins SynCo

Selenna Solange • YC125.05.05

Hatakani, The Citadel - In a shocking announcement, a new partnership was announced between the new and enigmatic entity known as Hatakani Trade Winds Combine [HAT] and SynCo. I-RCN has been covering for the last few months a number of power moves between HAT and I-RED, with the former orchestrating a number of significant trade deals with the veteran pro-State alliance. Rumors had been circulating for weeks now that HAT would eventually apply as a fully fledged member of SynCo, and they seem to have come to fruition.

“It is with great enthusiasm that SynCo welcomes our newest partner, the Hatakani Trade Winds Combine”, stated I-RED Director of Public Works Roirdan Bouchate. “HAT has shown excellent promise to deliver competent results to our shareholders, despite being a young organization. It is truly headed by some of the best executives the TNR Combine has to offer.”

Hatakani Trade Winds Combine is one of the newest capsuleer entities to spawn from the relatively recently formed TNR Combine faction of State politics - a megacorporate conglomerate consisting of the honorable Wiyrkomi Corporation, the venerable Hyasyoda Corporation, and the lauded Ishukone Corporation. Centerpoint of the alliance name is the system of Hatakani, where TNR Combine hosts a public meeting venue where executives from all three megacorporations meet to discuss matters which affect their bloc.

“The Ocean Trade Winds of Caldari folklore guide us towards the path of prosperity, or the path of doom”, commented I-RED Executor Alexandre Hinkelmann. “Naturally, we hope the spirits guide this new partnership between HAT and SynCo towards a continued path of increasing opportunity for all.”

Trading on the local stock markets seems to provide favorable approval of the new partnership between HAT and SynCo forces. Time will tell how the partnership will fare in the coming years.

Intaki Syndicate and SynCo Forces On High Alert Following Recent Triglavian Incursion
Selenna Solange • YC125.08.15

M2-CF1, Syndicate - In a surprise discovery, numerous Triglavian Collective taskforces were seen operating around the M2-CF1 area. Their activity prompted an immediate closure of Kandashi Station to all space traffic for a few hours while ISP was contacted for additional security measures. An ISP taskforce was dispatched to the station to provide 24 hour monitoring for local traffic. SynCo also provided additional security via a dispatched taskforce to the station.

Triglavian Collective forces are thought to have entered M2-CF1 via a X450-class wormhole that was present in the system of Angymonne. Triglavian forces are known to scout around, but it is typically very uncommon to see them operating around Syndicate. Their presence has activated a heightened response from the Intaki Space Police, as well as SynCo forces. The two groups are coordinating intel with each other and monitoring Triglavian activity in the area to ensure the safety of local shipping lanes.

If you are traveling in the area and wish to forward additional Triglavian activity sightings, please reach out to a local SynCo capsuleer member or contact the nearest ISP agent.

Ongoing Battles Across Syndicate Spill Into Solitude

Selenna Solange • YC125.08.20

XS-XAY, Syndicate - Syndicate as of the last month has been highly active with capsuleer activity. Scary Wormhole People [WHBOO] have made a concerted effort to attack SynCo forces in their area of operation, the 98Q superpocket in Syndicate. There have been numerous skirmishes between SynCo forces and WHBOO in the last weeks. The general trend so far seems to be that WHBOO is successful in completing their infrastructure sieges, but in the field they are outmaneuvered by SynCo forces and whittled down.

In a battle on 17th that unfortunately resulted in considerable losses for SynCo forces, allied forces were seen valiantly attempting to destroy a forward operating base operated by WHBOO in 6-U2M8. The electronic countermeasures put out by the WHBOO fleet alongside the structure ended up wreaking havoc on the SynCo fleet logistics wing, which quickly catapulted the tides of the battle in favor of WHBOO. SynCo forces managed to extract a large portion of the fleet, but considerable losses were still observed. For now, the WHBOO “beachhead” in 6-U2M8 remains.

The adjacent pocket to the 98Q superpocket has also seen impressive carnage, with Cynosural Field Theory [MOROS] reinforced every single EVE University [E-UNI] structure in the PC9-AY pocket of systems. MOROS had launched a concerted attack against E-UNI previously, to which multiple null-sec alliance power blocs formed to crush the encroaching MOROS assault. Although the previous attempt was thwarted, it remains to be seen if E-UNI can stop it again. It is not expected that E-UNI will have the same support from null-sec power blocs this time around.

The chaos and destruction across the region has attracted the attention of numerous large capsuleer organizations, one of them being Deepwater Hooligans. Across Syndicate and Solitude there has been a notable uptick in cynosural field activations, especially covert. Reports of ambushes on unsuspecting starships have skyrocketed, even prompting the DED to issue a travel advisory for commercial and industrial activities in the regions. Deepwater has already successfully launched numerous successful surprise attacks against WHBOO in the area.

I-RCN will continue to monitor ongoing battles across the two regions.

UPDATE: I-RCN has received news that E-UNI was successful in repelling the MOROS assault across the constellation under siege. E-UNI was able to amass a force of over 100 strong which, despite being mostly tech 1 cruisers, was able to dissuade the small but well equipped MOROS fleet from laying siege in their infrastructure. Additionally, in Solitude, a WHBOO capital ship extraction operation was uncovered by Deepwater surveillance teams - this resulted in significant losses in the billions of ISK for WHBOO. These capital ship losses are on top of the significant asset losses from the destruction of numerous large Upwell structures.

Utpattia Protectorate and San Mendinaeya Colonies Still Struggling With Ongoing Housing Woes

Taigeru Beldeia • YC125.08.23

XS-XAY, Syndicate - A combination of events over the last few months has contributed to an ongoing housing crisis among the Utpattia Protectorate cities of Atlas, Cloudfront, and Navyii Shuru; the jointly administered SynCo colony of San Mendinaeya has also been affected. During the Caldari State recall of workers earlier this year, I-RED dispatched a sizable portion of their Syndicate workforce back to the State core regions. Policy of the State recall of nonessential workers provided a stipulation that many other employees utilized in order to stay in Syndicate, however, and that was by applying for important jobs on the colonies in A-3ES3 and XS-XAY. This influx of new workers, combined with a shift in population due to the destruction of numerous SynCo structures, has created a housing shortage on the colonies in the area.

Relocation efforts of personnel in the highly populous 6-U2M8 Oriki Commercial Center were already well underway prior to the WHBOO incursion into the superpocket, but these efforts have been vastly increased since the WHBOO attacks. Furthermore, the great restructuring effort by SynCo following the Hatakani Trade Winds Combine [HAT] joining the coalition also caused additional personnel in need of somewhere to go. Many redundant structures were taken down. Excess personnel from these facilities were incorporated elsewhere, or were shifted to move to Utpattia and San Mendinaeya.

The relatively unexpected surge in additional population in a rather short period of time has put a strain on the housing markets both on Utpattia and San Mendinaeya. SynCo member organizations have worked hard with the San Mendinaeya colonial authority to erect as many public housing units as possible. The rapid growth in San Mendinaeya’s population has spawned the nickname of “XS” or “Excess City” among SynCo baseliners and capsuleers alike. The population of the jointly administered SynCo colony on XS-XAY IV, already in the millions strong, doesn’t seem to be slowing down any time soon.

Over on Utpattia, the Utpattia Protectorate government has weighed the benefits of establishing a fourth major city on the colony. The motion seems favorable among a slight majority of the population’s voters, but many are hesitant to add another major city and would prefer to just focus on development of the existing major cities of Atlass, Cloudfront, and Navyii Shuru. Given the mostly independent nature of the colony from its former creator, I-RED, public housing units have been coming along more slowly here than on San Mendinaeya.

I-RCN will continue the housing situation on both colonies in the coming months.

BREAKING: WHBOO Conflict Comes to a Close

Koren Akko • YC125.08.24

6-U2M8, Syndicate - Aboard the infamous “beachhead” Astrahus set up by WHBOO as preparation for an ongoing assault into the heart of SynCo territory, leadership from WHBOO and SynCo met to draft a resolution to end the conflict between the two parties. As part of the agreement, WHBOO will surrender the structure over to SynCo control in the coming weeks. Baseliner employees aboard the facility were given the option to be evacuated and leave with WHBOO or remain aboard as new employees under SynCo.

There are a number of other notable stipulations that came from the agreement between the formerly warring parties. Among them include that WHBOO will not be permitted to set up further infrastructure in Syndicate while SynCo will not set up additional structures in Solitude. The two organizations will enter a non-aggression pact for current and future infrastructure assets, not including starships.

Following the conclusion of the discussions, the WHBOO representatives were escorted off the facility and accompanied by SynCo security escort up until VV-VCR. Paparazzi photos and holoreels of the event were plastered all over various social media platforms. WHBOO, who had intentions of making SynCo a renter pet organization or simply “farm” SynCo for structure cores, had left disgracefully from the area in order to lick their wounds and recover what they could from their losses in Solitude at the hands of Deepwater Hooligans and others.

“I lost my mother to those bastards”, stated I-RED employee Raja Sirkonen. The starship engineer was emotional as he spoke to I-RCN press about the surrender of WHBOO. “She volunteered to remain aboard the 6-U2M8 Oriki Commercial Center as part of the essential skeleton crew when WHBOO laid siege on the mostly evacuated Astrahus…when the structure finally succumbed to their onslaught her escape pod was ruthlessly destroyed by those dishonorable guris. To have them surrender their fortress they hastily erected in this system back to us is mild vengeance, to say the least.” He continued, “to allow some of their baseliners to work for us is almost infuriating, but I cannot blame them for following the orders of the deranged capsuleers who employ them. I am blessed by Wind-of-the-West to follow the best Statesmen that Ishukone has to offer, and I will follow through on my service as my mother did - Ancestors watch over her.”

Similar tales of heroism and selflessness have spawned left and right among the ranks of SynCo members both capsuleer and noncapsuleer. The WHBOO War, as some call it, birthed a unity never before seen among the various entities which compose SynCo - I-RED, I-BLU, LUMEN, and HAT. In some ways, one may argue the war was a boon to creating a spark of solidarity among the different organizations. A stronger bond emerged between the groups as a result of the conflict, one that will likely continue to grow as time goes on.

LUMEN Celebrates 5 Year Anniversary Among Friends and Faithful

Taigeru Beldeia • YC125.08.27

Mehatoor, Devoid - In a momentous occasion, SynCo member Khimi Harar celebrated five years of active registration as a CONCORD-recognized organization. Furthermore, the occasion also marked the 10th year anniversary of the executive corporation in LUMEN, the Societas Imperialis Sceptri Coronaque (SFRIM). The event also celebrated a remarkable twenty years of active service of the venerable Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris alliance.

The jubilee was held aboard the SFRIM headquarters in the 24th Imperial Crusade station in Mehatoor. Various SynCo officials were in attendance, both Amarr and non-Amarr. The chapel ceremony of the event was broadcasted live across the throne regions, and as far as Syndicate. The sermon was led by LUMEN Chaplain Theodosius Savnar. Meanwhile, on a separate gala event held on Oris at the Excubitoris Chapter House, an impassioned speech was led by PIE Chapter Master Shaikar; this event was also broadcasted live across many regions.

The jubilee hosted dishes of traditional Amarrian cuisine, but also had a number of selections common in Syndicate. The fashion of attendees, of course, was also a hot topic of conversation among many observers. It is said that attendees of rival Amarr Houses were secretly trying to one-up each other. Fashion statements of the Caldari attendees was, naturally, predictably uniform and non-flashy. Perhaps the most flashy statement piece at the event was one worn by I-RCN’s very own Selenna Solange. True to form, Scarlet wore a four-piece blazing red ensemble - a scarlet ankle-long skirt, a scarlet strapless blouse, a ruby red semi-transparent skin sleeve covering up to the forearms, and a scarlet shawl to finish off the look.

A concert performance was held by the LUMEN Service Personnel Choir of the Syndicate Region. It is a project to help unify Khimi Harar’s multi-faceted personnel in the Syndicate region. It is a choir by and of baseliner serving personnel. They presented some of their favorites from the different cultural traditions making up the alliance’s forces in Syndicate.

Of controversy during the ceremony was the choice of selection for the final song of the choir - a song known as “Intaki’s Call.” This song has roots tied to the Autonomist movement of Intaki Prime, as well as inspiration from various groups such as the Intaki Liberation Front. In and across the Federation, the song is seen as a symbol of Intaki resistance and rebellion towards the traditional Federal vision for all member states. The lyrics of the song can be found below:

Come the day and come the hour
Come the power and the glory
We have come to answer
Syndicate’s call

Fromth fourteen constellations of Syndicate
Syndicate, Syndicate
Together standing tall
Shoulder to shoulder
We’ll answer Syndicate’s call

From the Cords of the Elements
From the remains of Reschard V
From the walls of Lenoika
And Akat Range

Fromth fourteen constellations of Syndicate
Syndicate, Syndicate
Together standing tall
Shoulder to shoulder
We’ll answer Syndicate’s call

Hearts of steel
And heads unbowing
Vowing never to be broken
We will fight, until
We can fight no more

The choice of this conclusion song stirred some drama, especially as the Empire and Federation recently agreed to non-intervention following the signing of the Pashanai Agreement. The move to allow the choir to present this song was only seen as adding fire between the traditionally contentious relationship between the Empire and Federation.

BREAKING: I-RED Submits Official Colonial Charter Developments Across DS-M4Q
Selenna Solange • YC125.09.22

UM-Q7F, Syndicate - More than ten years ago, I-RED was tasked with moving out to the frontiers of Syndicate in order to safeguard and advance Ishukone’s interests in the area. For ten years I-RED has worked tirelessly to develop the area economically for all, and to forge new relations with the Intaki Syndicate locals. With the gift of DS-M4Q to the Caldari State, I-RED had made numerous plans to rapidly develop areas of key interest for the Ishukone Corporation. Now that the State has officially opened colonial charters, I-RED made their move.

Across the nine systems of DS-M4Q, I-RED has submitted colonial development charters for twelve areas of interest. The string of submissions follows a more than decade-long mission of I-RED to continue developing Ishukone’s strength in foreign markets. Below we review some of the colony submissions.

In QWF-6P there are three submissions from I-RED. Two colonies with a primarily industrial focus are proposed for QWF-6P I and the 14th moon of QWF-6P VI. A private survey prospector analysis that was done early following the change in status of DS-M4Q to the Caldari State shows an abundance of valuable materials on the planet of QWF-6P I. I-RED has not shared details of this constellation-wide survey, but there seems to be considerable effort to erect a strong industrial colony on the planet. Securing the colony on the planet will likely prove to be a boon for I-RED and their respective shareholders. Meanwhile, QWF-6P VI-14 is a large icy moon the size of a small rocky world. Beneath a thick icy crust is a subsurface ocean of water that is heated both from the size of the moon itself but also the tidal forces acting on it by its host planet. The colony proposition from I-RED here seems to have a dual role of industry and science research. The third colonial development is a commercial colony centered on tourism and a resort casino on the ocean world of QWF-6P III. It is rumored that I-RED may be finishing the details of a partnership with NOH affiliates for the development of this colony.

Another couple colonies were proposed in the system of UM-Q7F, which also functions as the central staging point for the Caldari State in the constellation. A coastal region of UM-Q7F IX, the only temperate planet in the system, was selected for colonization. The proposed colony by I-RED would develop agricultural sectors in the area alongside fishing business. The location is also ideally situated as a waypoint between two Caldari Navy facilities being constructed on the planet. A second colonial proposition is yet another large icy moon - UM-Q7F X-10. Similar to the QWF-6P VI-14 colonial proposal, this one also has a focus on industry and research.

I-RED seems intent to keep developing DS-M4Q alongside the Caldari State for the foreseeable future. UM-Q7F now functions as a primary staging point for the group in Syndicate. While I-RED’s goals are primarily focused on developing economic opportunities for the State and Intaki Syndicate, they are also keen on fortifying the area and increasing military cooperation between the State and Syndicate. The discovery of Zarzakh and joint cooperation between the Guristas and Angel Cartel have sparked a desire within I-RED to secure the State’s frontier interests as a whole.

EZA-FM, Syndicate - It is no known secret that there are some station governments within the Intaki Syndicate diaspora who crave more favorable relations with their Gallente Federation neighbors. The EZA-FM Station Co-Operative is perhaps the most prominent of these pro-Federation subfactions within the Syndicate. Almost two years ago, most of the en Kishari family, the owners of this faction, were brutally killed in an attack led by the infamous Aenebra cult. The killing even prompted the Syndicate de facto leader Silphy en Diabel to accuse Serpentis of using the Aenebra cult as proxies.

Now the son of Agrele Anneu, a high ranking officer loyal to the en Kishari family aboard the EZA-FM Intaki Syndicate station, has been killed in what seems to be a targeted hovercar bomb. Augariel Anneu was killed this morning when he was attempting to start his hovercar to travel to a political function held aboard the station. The vehicle was completely destroyed, an exclusive Essentia hovercar built by I-RED subsidiary Myoka Galactic. Myoka Galactic released a public statement condemning the attack and offering condolences to the Anneu family, as well as others who were injured in the explosion.

Half a dozen bystanders were injured by debris from the explosion, with two being in serious condition. It is expected that they will make a recovery with time. The Anneu family has not released a public statement at this time, instead asking for privacy while investigations are ongoing. Augariel was said to be a protégé of one of the slain en Kishari family leaders. He was an outspoken aspiring politician who advocated for the mending of relations between the Intaki Syndicate and Gallente Federation.

Supporters from Syndicate and the Federation took to social media to convey their angry and sadness at the loss of his life. “A bright young soul taken from us too soon by uncontrolled corruption stemming from Poitot itself - what a shame, what a shame”, posted one Federation senator on Peeper™.

I-RCN will continue to monitor this developing story as the ISP investigate who was behind the hovercar bomb attack.

Varyazi Clade transport shot down near Pance Chattan archipelago by Expert Intervention.
Planetside Combat Activity in M2-CF1 Seems to Settle
Koren Akko • YC125.09.24

M2-CF1, Syndicate - Activity from warclone insurgents near the M2-CF1 IV Pance Chattan resort casino seems to draw near a close as warclone fleet ships registered to be under operation of the Varyazi Clade extract from the area. The Pance Chattan resort casino is officially registered as an independent entity, but rumored to be funded by the powerful Kandashi family who also operate the only public station in the system. The archipelagos near the resort casino are famous across Syndicate and beyond for their tropical beauty and lush vegetation. There is also a famous artificial reef which functions as a popular tourist attraction. An orbital skyhook functions as the primary means of transportation to and from the planet, which is otherwise mostly undeveloped - as is the norm for most Syndicate worlds.

The presence of Varyazi Clade forces follows a recent Triglavian Collective incursion into the system. It is not yet known the reason for Varyazi warclone presence on the surface of the planet, but it prompted a swift response from Expert Intervention forces who were hired to repel the invading forces. While most of the combat between the two groups occurred far enough away from the populated sectors of the Pance Chattan archipelago, the casino was on lockdown regardless. The primary reason for this lockdown was actually because of a powerful typhoon rolling in and bringing dangerous conditions - powerful ocean surges, fierce winds, and torrential downpour.

SynCo forces received multiple distress calls from the planet, but weather conditions prevented any sort of assistance being rendered. Calls for aid were instead relayed to the local Syndicate detachment of Sisters of Eve, who quickly established a position in orbit to render aid following the passing of the typhoon from the archipelago. A sizable security taskforce from Internal Security provided reinforcements to the Expert Intervention forces on the ground. I-RCN has not received reports of any notable engagements in orbit between Varyazi Clade ships and Internal Security.

SRSPPL Repel Attempt from Pirate Entities to Establish Foothold in 98Q Superpocket
Koren Akko • YC125.10.06

VV-VCR, Syndicate - The SynCo Regional Space Police & Patrol (SRSPPL) stopped the hostile entity xXPlease Pandemic Citizens Reloaded Alliance.Xx [TERBL] from establishing a foothold in the 98Q superpocket. SRSPPL, along with an assortment of related allies from Intergalactic Space Hobos and Phoenix Naval Systems, managed to outform TERBL more than three to one. The much larger SRSPPL defense fleet made quick work of the anchoring Astrahus-class citadel, although SynCo leadership was concerned for a potential escalation from TERBL. Ultimately the TERBL fleet was in fact not holding a secret ace card, and their forces were quickly crippled.

“The recent war against Scary Wormhole People has seemingly spawned a new coalition in the making”, commented one capsuleer warfare analyst. “It is suspected that SynCo has made a pact with the likes of groups such as Phoenix Naval Systems and Intergalactic Space Hobos…even if nothing official has come from the press offices of any of those organizations.”

It is true that there has been no official word of a formal coalition being made between the aforementioned parties. Speculation has grown over a new coalition of different organizations across Syndicate who band together to face outside threats. Time will tell if this speculation ends up being true. For now, however, I-RCN will continue to report on defense initiatives to protect the 98Q superpocket against potential invaders.

Space elevator system constructed by Caldari Navy on UM-Q7F IX
BREAKING: IRV Spirit of Malkalen Deployed to DS-M4Q to Aid in I-RED Colonial Efforts
Selenna Solange • YC125.10.09

UM-Q7F, Syndicate - I-RED leadership recently announced the deployment of their massive corporate-scale warbarge, IRV Spirit of Malkalen, to the constellation of DS-M4Q. The Spirit of Malkalen is the second most-prized starship under I-RED command, after the Leviathan-class IRV Gariushi-Oriki. Both vessels are constantly kept under strict protection, and I-RED command takes great lengths to obfuscate their exact locations at any given time.

The Spirit of Malkalen was purchased by I-RED in YC115. Constructed in the renown Ishukone shipyards of Korama, the Spirit of Malkalen was part of a second generation of corporate warbarge that made numerous improvements to the original design. The original hulls of this class of ship, the Amaterasu class, were designed solely for colonization support and have been in use for more than six decades. They ultimately also gained a new role as Ground Assault Reinforcement, Redeployment, Information Support, & Orbital Nexus centers, or more affectionately known as GARRISONs. GARRISONs came about as rising intergalactic tensions spawned the CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act war zone, which forced the leading ship designers of the State to retrofit the aging colony ships for ground support in the CEMWPA frontlines. It wasn’t until the dawn of widespread clone soldiers in New Eden that the ship classification of “warbarge” became synonymous with GARRISONs. Spirit of Malkalen was the second hull to be built out of an original goal of fifteen to be constructed for the Ishukone Corporation. However, due to financial woes in YC115 caused by internal strife in the Caldari State as a result of the fall of the Provist regime, Ishukone ended up only finishing ten hulls of the “Spirit” line of warbarge. The four hulls finished in YC115 were Spirit of the Citadel, Spirit of Malkalen, Spirit of Korama, and Spirit of Heiian, with the rest of the ships of the class being finished a couple years after, with additional upgraded systems.

These second generation ships retained roughly the same dimensions as the first generation hulls, but utilized better space saving design of the internal ship bay, and other updated systems. Rather than having Cestus-class mobile command centers stored horizontally and launched out of port and starboard side openings, the hangar orientations were shifted vertically to instead “drop” the ships in quick succession after opening up the underside of the warbarge. This design change significantly increased the MCC ferrying capacity by twofold. Space saving design also allowed for a greater number of personnel to be carried aboard each Spirit warbarge, thereby amplifying their potential in whatever mission they were assigned. Additionally, internal systems were overhauled with more efficient technology - namely, auto-manufacturing centers, computer cores, engineering subsystems, and enhanced defenses.

The Spirit warbarges, much like their Amaterasu formers, have a segmented hull split into five distinct areas. From bow to stern they are: MCC launch bay, auxiliary launch bay, logistics launch bay, ground support launch bay, and manufacturing sector. The MCC launch bay houses all the necessary equipment for storing MCCs not in use as well as maintenance and repair functions. The auxiliary launch bay is oriented in a more conventional horizontal format, and is modular in the sense that it can be organized according to the needs of a specific deployment. Often, however, this bay is used to house a small fleet of resource gathering vessels and atmospheric-capable fighters and bombers. The logistics launch bay houses Swan-class heavy transports which are capable of airlifting modular structures used to establish colonies and forward operating bases on land. These deployable infrastructure are housed here for easy fitting to Swan transports. The ground support launch bay houses an assortment of vehicles, supplies, and other necessities that can be ferried planetside via Cygnet-class light transports and Sparrow-class dropships. Finally, the aptly named manufacturing sector houses an assortment of automated assembly facilities for constructing new vehicles, crafts, and supplies utilizing resources fed to them by the harvester fleet.

Spirit of Malkalen was sold to the longstanding Ishukone-loyalist capsuleer entity I-RED in order to help Ishukone recover some immense costs associated with the development of the Spirit warbarges. The exact details of this transaction have never been publicly released, but many speculate the cost was somewhere around that of a Leviathan-class titan. Spirit of Malkalen was quickly deployed to Placid and Syndicate, where it has played an invaluable role in projecting I-RED’s influence in the areas. Whenever there was a need for a staging platform for ground operations, the IRV Spirit of Malkalen was there. Oftentimes, the ship can be seen being escorted by a sizable taskforce consisting of Eagle heavy assault cruisers, Vulture command ships, and Raven battleships. Other times it is simply trailed by a fleet of covert ops ships, ready to uncloak and deploy reinforcements at a moment’s notice. The escorting taskforce as well as the Spirit of Malkalen mission assets vary from deployment to deployment.

In DS-M4Q, it is expected that the IRV Spirit of Malkalen will be the base of operations for I-RED’s colonial developments across the constellation. I-RCN will continue to monitor the developing colonial efforts.

Protests Erupt on Intaki Prime Following Bombing Incidents in Federal Navy Orbital Facilities
Taigeru Beldeia • YC125.10.11

Intaki, Placid - With two bombings occurring so far this year by malevolent actors, many people in Intaki are calling into question the competency of the Federation Navy. In February YC125, the Tears of Reschard Intaki radicalist group laid claim to numerous bombings across a number of different Federation facilities, including the navy anchorage above Intaki Prime. Meanwhile, September also saw bombings in the Federal Navy facilities 1 orbiting Intaki Prime by as of yet unknown anti-Federation terrorists. The nature of these attacks in what is the headquarters of the Federation Navy has left many questions on the table.

“How can we expect to feel ‘safe’ when the [Federation] Navy just allows terrorists to bomb their fortresses above our skies”, scathingly shouted a protest leader in Lenoika. “The Federation has failed us time and time again, and we demand answers!”

Intaki Autonomists and the more nationalistic Intaki Lamkatka parties have both been making noticeable strides in recent months, especially following the two bombings that took place this year. The presiding leader of the majority moderate party of the Intaki Assembly, Councillor Vera en Sullacio, has not had much substantive words to say regarding the security situation of the system. This has led to further populations on colonies across the system to sway more towards the Autonomist and Lamkatka parties.

For their part, Chief Councillor of the Intaki Assembly Jonas Ivestara has been noted to be in talks with the Federation Navy regarding the attacks, and has appointed a special investigation unit on how the attacks were allowed to happen. Meanwhile, Lamkatka party leader Siaka Idama has been observed to be taking part in peaceful protests demanding answers from the Federation government.

Intaki Prime has in recent months recovered from considerable social upheaval that followed the Federation Navy invasion of Viriette and Fislipesnes. The recent wave of protests regarding numerous attacks against the Federation Navy facilities in the system has sparked a new wave of social uncertainty for the people of Intaki. I-RCN will continue to monitor this developing story.
