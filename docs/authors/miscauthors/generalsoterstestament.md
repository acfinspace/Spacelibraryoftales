Inspired by an ancient Rovenour-era poem considered by Gallente historians to be a quintessential example of the tenets of asymmetrical warfare during the period. This modern version captures the fighting spirit of Federal Defense Union forces in the years they fought to liberate Federation systems from State Protectorate occupation, which formed the foundation for their later dominance of the warzone.

*In derpfits should be all Gallente war<br>Let novice and smalls their foes debar<br>And staging citadels prove such an arm<br>*
*That enemies do them no harm.<br>In hidden JFs keep every store<br>And burn the plexes them before<br>*
*So, when they find the land lie waste<br>Needs must they pass away in haste<br>*
*Harried by cunning raids at night<br>And threatening sounds from every height<br>*
*Then, as they leave, with great array<br>Smite with the Mach and chase away.<br>This is the counsel and intent<br>Of Good General Soter’s Testament*
