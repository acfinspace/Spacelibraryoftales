Trigs or Empire, which one to chose?<br>
Which is the better, the better to use.

One has numbers with plenty of ships to be had.<br>
The other fights hard and scares the childrens to bed.

Which is the best the best to chose? Why not play both! As this capsuler’s immortal and can truly never lose!
