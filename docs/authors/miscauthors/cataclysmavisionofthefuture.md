Oh you endless capsuleers<br>
Who deal in fire and blood and fear<br>
Look at the storm, we must defend.<br>
The storm will mark our grisly end.

Let not the sound of battle seed doubt.<br>
War becomes us, even without<br>
The blood and steel and weapons of old.<br>
We are immortal. So we must hold.

On they come, they blot out the light.<br>
And finally an ends in sight.<br>
Yet more pour in, the ancient force.<br>
Like water poured from the source.

The last round fires, we are ready to drown.<br>
But the open gate comes crashing down.<br>
Letting death come forth no more.<br>
And so, for a moment, we’ve won the war.
