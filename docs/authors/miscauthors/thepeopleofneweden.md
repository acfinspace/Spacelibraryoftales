Amarrian Captains, they place with care,<br>
volleys of laser fire, both of pulse and of beam,<br>
When looking for slaves they’ll go anywhere<br>
But for Matari they’re particularly keen.<br>

The Minmatar Captains are blessed (or cursed)<br>
With ships that are extraordinarily fleet,<br>
Though with all the duct tape they must be nursed,<br>
So a victory will be both bitter and sweet.<br>

The Caldari Captains work for the state,<br>
Through megacorps that are both rich and powerful,<br>
Don’t mention Tibus Heth (they’ll get irate)<br>
And point their blaster cannons right at your capsule.<br>

The Gallente Captains, they love their drones,<br>
Little angels of death flittering here and there,<br>
The captain who warps off without them groans,<br>
When he or she finds the local market is bare.<br>

The Angel Cartel pirates live in Curse,<br>
Where they avail themselves of all kinds of mischief,<br>
As far as pirates go, they could be worse,<br>
At least to them your clone’s blood isn’t a foodstuff!<br>

The Blood Raider pirates, now they love blood,<br>
They think it's delicious and makes them immortal,<br>
If you’re approaching gate and hear a thud,<br>
Pray you don’t see that bright blood red flag and white skull.<br>

The Serpentis pirates are drug runners,<br>
They’ll have any and all boosters you want in store,<br>
They use gas clouds to make tranquillisers,<br>
Blue pill, Sooth Sayer, Drop, Mindflood and many more.<br>

The Guristas pirates are colorful,<br>
Started by two Caldari, Fatal and Rabbit,<br>
Though their logo is cute, they’re not docile,<br>
Their well placed missiles can cause you much discomfit.<br>

Sansha’s Nation, now they are all zombies,<br>
Created and controlled by Kuvakei himself,<br>
They’re cruel and they’re harsh (just like space Nazis),<br>
So when flying around Stain look after yourself.<br>

Now, last, but far from least, we have Concord,<br>
They’re the policemen, the coppers, of New Eden,<br>
Many a brave capsuleer has deplored,<br>
The swift and mighty justice of CONCORDOKKEN!!<br>

Filled with people is this place, New Eden,<br>
Some are good and some evil, but to you I swear,<br>
It’s all of our duties to enlighten,<br>
The misguided soul known as the high sec carebear!<br>
