It was fifteen years ago today,<br>
That PIE first entered the fray,<br>
They’ve never really gone out of style,<br>
And they’re guaranteed to raise a smile,<br>
So may I raise a glass,<br>
The corp we’ve known for all these years,<br>
Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris!

We’re Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris,<br>
For God we’re always fighting,<br>
We’re Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris,<br>
Reclaiming’s always been our thing,<br>
Praetoria Imperialis, Praetoria Imperialis,<br>
Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris,<br>
It’s wonderful to be Amarr,<br>
It’s certainly a thrill,<br>
There’s so many errant Minmatars,<br>
We’d like to take them home with us,<br>
We’d love to take them home.

I don’t really want to stop the show,<br>
But I thought that you might like to know,<br>
That the CEO’s called Shaikar,<br>
And he wants you all to be so pure,<br>
So let me introduce to you,<br>
The one and only Admiral Shaikar,<br>
And Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris!
