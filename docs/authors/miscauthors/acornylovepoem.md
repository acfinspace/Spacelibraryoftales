You said my love would always leave you wanting,<br>
As you lay on the floor curled up in a ball panting,<br>
Crying out with breathless gasp of delight,<br>
That my leaving would fill you with fright,<br>

But now my dear let me be your adviser,<br>
What you felt you cannot tell between my love and my taser.<br>
