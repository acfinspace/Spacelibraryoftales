Soft leaves dripping with the dew of golden hue,<br>
Sun gleaming, grass glimmering - all these things and more Cold Wind did imbue.

A velvet haze looming over the land,<br>
The mighty Kaalakiota peaks off in the distance - so seemingly rough and jagged to the hand.

Grinning and breathing, he grabs a handful of soil,<br>
Crisp morning air and fresh sunlight - a dawn so perfect not even trickster Storm Wind can foil.

Cold Wind carrying the chirps of hardy winter birds,<br>
Beneath his worn feet, curious Oriyoni blossoms - the vibrant flowers always bloom in thirds.

From inside the modest home, a tea kettle brimming with hot tea,<br>
She carefully crushes select Kresh leaves - a winter-white tundra beyond as wide as the sea.

Sipping and laughing together, the hot tea works wonder,<br>
It numbs the icy kiss of Cold Wind’s lips - they peer out to spot Mountain Wind in the yonder.

Sapphire waters crashing against bastion-like rock,<br>
Wooden ships sail amidst turbulent waters - Wind-of-the-West may choose to mock.

K’vire and Deteaas all around stirring and bustling, from the forests to the bay,<br>
Heart-of-the-Forest need not provide direction - Caldari of all backgrounds know The Way.
