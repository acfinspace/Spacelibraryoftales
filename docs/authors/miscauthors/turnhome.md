> Entry for YC121 New Eden Capsuleer’s Writing Contest in the Poetry category.


After many miles of travel and work<br>
I turn home<br>
With the cool breeze off the blue hills<br>
I turn home<br>
With the sun behind and the first evening stars above the distant hills,<br>
I turn home.<br>
I turn home…<br>
To the food that awaits me and the bed that beckons me.<br>
I turn home.<br>
To the community who raised me and the house that sheltered me.<br>
I turn home.<br>
To the mother who loved me and the father who taught me.<br>
I turn home.
