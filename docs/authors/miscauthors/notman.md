Why does the Sun call out<br>
For worship and war<br>
Why does man stride forth<br>
To drive obedience in his sway<br>
I dance in night, in stars embrace<br>
I care not for the sun nor the man

The moon brings gentleness in my heart<br>
While the night drives fear its own way<br>
I cast aside the man and the sun<br>
Find the night enthralled<br>
I embrace the night<br>
And follow evils sway.
