Wake in our bunks, crucial day for our hole,<br>
Today we defend, calling every last soul.<br>
Breakfast is served, then we form for parade,<br>
Haulers arriving with torpedoes of rage.<br>

An alert goes out, “the Fedos have escaped!”<br>
Our squad shoot them all, now the walls are blood-caked.<br>
Marines have their lunch, the mess hall is packed,<br>
The scouts burst in, “multiple hostiles tracked!”<br>

Hear the call to arms, janitors hiding in fear,<br>
Reinforcement ends, “Take Control!” cries our leader.<br>
The enemy lands with logistics and all,<br>
Vedmaks vs Bombers, this could be the wrong call.<br>

“We need bombing rigs” screams a pilot, enraged,<br>
Hulls taking damage, Vedmaks fully engaged.<br>
Citadel goes down! Our defence was a flop<br>
and this marine didn’t survive the loot drop.<br>
