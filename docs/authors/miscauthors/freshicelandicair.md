> Entry for YC125 New Eden Capsuleer’s Writing Contest in the OOC category.


Recently I was given a gift<br>
Eve Online presented me with<br>
Year end Christmas giveaway<br>
Known for developing EVE the great game I play<br>
Joined their stream to show my support<br>
As I watched, and joined in games, I saw the report<br>
Visually, across the screen, my eyes picked up<br>
Is this real, could this be true, what great luck<br>
Known for their generosity, this blew me away<br>
In September under the aurora I will stay<br>
Calling my name as the winner of tickets to Fanfest<br>
Ecstatic is an understatement to say it best<br>
Long hours spent playing this game<br>
All transportation and hotel booked, I can’t wait to get on that plane<br>
Never did I think I would ever make it there<br>
Don’t worry, in September I will be breathing that…
