Oh grand old dame, how proudly did you rule<br>
the empty shores beyond the promised land,<br>
where many forlorn pilgrims’ tortured souls<br>
found consolation in your lonely home.<br>

Though your old skin was scarred by many fights,<br>
and wrinkly spotted by the laser-weld repairs,<br>
not for a second did your godly suitor ever cease<br>
caressing you with most majestic whisps of light.<br>

Now, as the curtain falls on your old age<br>
and you can finally lay down<br>
the lifelong shackles of timidity and pride,<br>

you -at last!- reach out to touch God’s Mouth,<br>
with exploding light outshining heaven’s might<br>
as your first and final kiss.<br>
