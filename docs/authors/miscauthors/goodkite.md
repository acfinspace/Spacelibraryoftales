A sleek silver silhouette,<br>
Pirouetting through the endless stars.<br>
A Condor dances with a Catalyst,<br>
Scourge missiles striking its curves.<br>
The Catalyst cannot reach the bird of prey,<br>
But his Algos friend may.<br>
An angry horde of irate drones,<br>
Unleashed upon the bird,<br>
The drones track him down.<br>
Good night, little bird of prey,<br>
A beautiful explosion it makes.<br>
 
An Imperial Navy Slicer, you know he must be elite.<br>
A small frigate gang, he should be able to beat.<br>
A Slasher comes out at him, approaching fast!<br>
But the Slicer deftly moves to the side - the Slasher flies way past.<br>
The Slicer’s beams focus onto the hull,<br>
And there the Slasher dies,<br>
They can hear its pilot’s angry cries.<br>
A Taranis bears down on the slicer,<br>
Trying to ruin his day,<br>
But using feathering, the Slicer is able to keep him away.<br>
But now the slicers cap is critically low,<br>
The pilot thinks it’s time to go,<br>
And so, he warps away.<br>
The Slicer lives to see another day.<br>
 
A Legion light attack craft, fending off the blob.<br>
A Sabre chasing it takes a faceful of missiles - the pilot sobs.<br>
It turns to run, to ruin the Garmur’s fun.<br>
As its shields and armor are stripped away,<br>
The Sabre pilot thinks he will again see the light of day.<br>
The Garmur pilot yells, “No way!”<br>
The Sabre is disrupted, stopped from warping 50km away.<br>
The Sabre pilot face becomes red with rage,<br>
Today it seems, is not his day.<br>
The Legion pilot laughs with joy,<br>
Rejoicing at this evil deed,<br>
He praises his loyal steed.<br>
Balanced Legion indeed.<br>
