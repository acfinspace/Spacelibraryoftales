(CDL-W1)

Once again I sit in a lonely Citadel far away and alone. Abandoned by the once powerful Alliance only to collapse and close down due to internal strife. And all that is left from a one time thriving Corporation is only CEO and myself. While he searches the galaxy for a new home I’m left to close down the office and liquidate all assets in a hostile Region for a new start somewhere beyond in the stars. Sitting here I dwell on the great fleet ups and the fun and prosperous industrial complex with friends that turned into family, only to disintegrate. Now I hope for a new group to once again be what I always wanted. A Home

(CDL-W2)

It’s been several days since I was in communication with the CEO. As ordered, all corporate assets have been liquidated and put into the corporate wallet. Unable to contact him I decided to wait, hoping that he didn’t also decided to leave it all. Besides where am I’m going to go? Walking around in an empty station alone for so long I’ve decided to take my T3C and explore the lonely and treacherous Wormholes. Jumping through hole after hole not bookmarking anything. Just drifting and watching fleet engagements from afar. Coming across ancient Relic and Data sites to try to scrape up some kind loot. Now my T3C has turned into my home. Have I now become a Nomad? Wandering without a home or a friend? I think about these things as I shut down the ship to again sleep and dream of things to hopefully come.

(CDL-W3)

Again I wake up to a dark and lonely ship floating in a C4 Wormhole. It’s been twelve days since I had any communication from the Boss. His whereabouts are unknown. I wonder if he will ever come back? It was a heavy blow to him to see the Alliance and Corporation crumble. He put allot into it as any CEO would. His last communication to me was not his usual upbeat words. His last order was only to liquidate all and wait for new location coordinates. Seeing the multi Billions of isk in the Corp wallet makes me want to take it and drop Tags and start anew. But to start what? To go where? I’m not a leader to start and new Corp. Why even jump to another system? Why Probe or DScan? My cargo bay is at max capacity with the most expensive loot I came across. Jettisoning the lower loot for only the best. All for what? I must wait for the only one I know, my Friend, my Commander.

(CDL-W4)

Found a Wormhole Entrance to HS today, wasn’t sure I wanted to leave Wormhole, however looking around my ship is was filthy and low on supplies. As I looked into the mirror I see that I needed to get cleaned up. I let myself go and am not the pilot I was or want to be. I started to ponder again my future. Do I drop tags to join a Corporation? Just going through the process of it is exhausting to me. I don’t know what to do. As I was here thinking on these things watching yet another structure being bashed, I noticed the red light blinking of an incoming message. It was the Boss.

He told me he was sorry for not staying in touch but was hospitalized. Hopefully will be back soon.

He said to take Corp funds and establish a drug manufacturing location and will contact me as soon as he can.

I had my own drug manufacturing back in the day and still have all the BPC’s and Reaction Formulas but they were located in a NPC station deep in the Caldari Faction Warfare system. However I finally have a new purpose, new orders to carry out. So I plotted new waypoint through the Wormhole to HS to a New Hope.?

(CDL-W5)

Made my way to the HS Wormhole, jumping through I quickly scanned my location. The Dark and Rusty Minmatar Space. Not what I was hoping for, my standings are not good here but decided to scan the different systems looking for a new location for our drug manufacturing HQ.

I put yet another ping out to the Boss, no response. Hope all is well. Made my way to the quiet and lonely trading hub of RENs for repairs, supplies and to sell the loot I got out of K Space.

I found a NPC Station in a Low Security dead-end system , which intelligence reported it to be a lightly traveled system.

So I purchased a large fleet that was needed to provide the materials for this type of business. However before I contract a courier service I decided to fly out there and see who and what was really happening there. I’m hoping that there are no low life pirates out there that I will have to deal with, but in Eve that is unlikely. Regardless, I’m moving in and will not waist anymore time searching the stars for a home.

(CDL-W6)

Alone yet again, ninja huffing gas, looking out at a far away Nebula, I find myself again reminiscing times past where we had large mining fleets, having purpose and having great conversations. Brothers and Sisters bantering back and forth making life long memories. Memories, only memories. The Drug Manufacturing is in full swing now but it’s slow and go. I’m running the whole operation and it’s very profitable. Selling to the different Faction Warfare Pilots. War is good for business it seems. But to what end? Waiting for my leader to come back to get us back to the way we were with a different family. Only he has the charisma to do such a thing. I hope he is okay but it’s been so long now that I’m losing hope. How long do I wait? How long do I go on?

As I crawl back into my sleep chamber I wonder if the time set I put was too long this time?

(CDL-W7)

Again I stand alone in this NPC station that once was a deserted place to set up shop but has turned into a heavily occupied system. The friendly Corporation that allowed me to use their biochemical reactor has turned against me because they wanted a large percentage of the profits and has closed me out and held my powder and reactions Blueprints for ransom, making me pay four billion to recover.

I complied and asked them to give me a week to liquidate assets to bring them the and they agreed.

Instead I hired mercenaries to take down the structure. The Corporation CEO knew it was me who called the Merc’s and asked me to call them off. I did not respond but watched the structure implode. They were no match for the these elite hired thugs.

Now all I do is huff gas and sell for profit.

It’s a boring existence but the money is unmatched in any other venture I would do.

Right then I received a message from the Boss. Message read: Standby to move operations to Pochven. Liquidate all drugs and all materials only. Keep Gas operations docked up and locked down. Make way to Jita in five days. Will meet up with you then. Fly Safe. Pochven? WT…….?
