> Entry for YC125 New Eden Capsuleer’s Writing Contest in the OOC category.



In EVE Online, a universe vast and wide,<br>
A history of twenty years resides inside,<br>
A game of friendship, war, creation, and strife,<br>
A world where you can live a second life.

You’ll find true friends, alliances to build,<br>
With wars to wage and empires to rebuild,<br>
Create and destroy, explore and learn,<br>
In this online world, your passions will burn.

A universe of stars, ships, and intrigue,<br>
A place where you can let your imagination besiege,<br>
EVE Online, the best game of all time,<br>
A world where you can leave reality behind.

So come and join, be part of the fray,<br>
EVE Online, where dreams come to play,<br>
With battles to win and treasures to find,<br>
A universe that will forever be kind.
