A coffee warms my hands, at a table.<br>
I can see the bookshelf,<br>
not far from the pastry cabinet

Faith, comedy, tragedy.

Take a book down, settle in for a time<br>
Warm the soul, rest the mind.<br>
Breathe.

Everyone takes a look, takes a book.<br>
Hears its call.<br>
Breathes.

Faith, comedy, tragedy.

A coffee warms my hands, at a table,<br>
I can see the bookshelf.<br>
Why was the book put back?

A time, a place, a face.<br>
Was it face? Was it laced?<br>
Did you fear disgrace?

Faith, comedy, tragedy.

Some say your kind are poison.<br>
I like to disagree.<br>
I disagree.

We’ve all our callings, our places and faces.<br>
Can’t curse the faith, can’t sing another song<br>
Just breathe

Faith, comedy, tragedy.
