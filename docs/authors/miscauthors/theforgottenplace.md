A child sits in the forgotten place<br>
dreaming of days yet to be<br>
Cannot she know, oh God, cannot she see<br>
The heartache to come<br>
Yet Blessed shall she be

The wicked march in the hallowed place<br>
Holy admonition yet to be<br>
Cannot she fight, oh God, cannot she see<br>
Righteous heart to beat<br>
Yet Blessed shall she be

The blood cools in the forlorn place<br>
Hurt's last gleaming never to be<br>
Cannot she be, oh God, cannot she see<br>
Pain drowned in waters dark<br>
Yet Blessed shall she be

A woman stands in the remembered place<br>
dreaming of that which was not to be<br>
Cannot she see, oh God, cannot she be<br>
Innocence lost to crusader born<br>
Yet Blessed shall she be
