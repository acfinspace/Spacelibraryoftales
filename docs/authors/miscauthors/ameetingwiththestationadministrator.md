As I enter the station administrator's outer office I can tell she's a woman who is used to living in relative luxury. The furnishings are of excellent quality and would likely make any planet sider either envious or nervous. Judging by the reaction of her aide, though, I can tell my visit has stirred up exactly those feelings in my host rather than in the guest as usual. I can't help but hold back a little ironic smile as I'm shown directly into the inner office. Being the personal assistant to a capsuleer has it's benefits.

Out of respect for the station administrator, and I must confess also to help put her at ease, I wait until a chair is offered before sitting. I flash a smile as if to say 'everything will be alright' and dive straight into business.

“Thank you for seeing me on such short notice Administrator, as you know I represent a capsuleer who has business in this system and will be requiring facilities at your station. I understand you got the request on sub-space comms before my arrival.”

“Ah, yes, about that. I'm not sure we'll be able to accommodate all those request on such short notice without incurring rather large expenses.”

And there it is. The one thing that, without fail, motivates nearly everyone I've come across. The station administrator is doing the math in her head. She knows that hosting a capsuleer in a far out of the way station such as hers is an exorbitantly expensive prospect. She also knows that capsuleers can almost always pay for such extravagances out of their pocket money. She is wanting to know if my employer is willing to cover all costs up front, likely with a hefty markup.

“I have established a fund already and deposited enough Interstellar Kredits to cover necessary costs.” It never hurts to spread some money around, especially in deep space like this. “We do, however, require your utmost discretion concerning any matters related to the business at hand. This station was chosen specifically because of it's remoteness.”

While the station manager is checking the status of the funds I've just mentioned I take a moment to study her reaction. I've set up an account with a paltry sum of 1 million ISK, which to someone in my position won't even cover the cost of a single replacement part on the ship, but to anyone not used to capsuleers would seem an incredible fortune. She barely reacts to seeing that sum. Obviously she's been around more than one capsuleer.

“The funds seem to be in order, but I must ask about your request to have a contingent of marines posted nearby our medical clone facility. The request for that much security seems odd coming from a capsuleer, and I can assure you that our security personnel are more than capable of handling any problems that may arise.”

I lead with a disarming smile before replying. “It's not a request administrator. A contingent of marines will be disembarking with my employer and will be on call and stationed near the medical clone facility at all times when my employer is off station.”

Her face is quite impassive and I must admit I'm a bit impressed. I make a mental note to do some research on this station administrator before our next meeting.

“I think our business should be concluded now administrator. You know how to contact me and I've just been informed my employer's ship has finished it's docking protocol. I trust that you have a suitable hangar ready”
