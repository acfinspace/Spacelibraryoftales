Here in EVE i travelled near and far,<br>
but eventually my home became Amarr.
 
The beautiful space and the golden ships told me,<br>
this is the place that wil finally hold me.

I saw pirates and Concord and i just knew,<br>
that to them i just look like a little Shrew.

After mining, ratting and trading,<br>
in the end it left me debating

Is the Eve life any different down in Null,<br>
or is it the same because high is getting kind of dull.

So one day i put on my big boy shoes and headed down,<br>
only to be met  by a caracal fleet and soon my beloved ship went down.

As i sat in station thinking about what happened,<br>
i saw an EVEmail pop up and i felt baffled!

The Caracal FC sent me a mail,<br>
telling me it was impossible to prevail.

He gave me some tips that were quite welcome,<br>
i thought to myself well this is something that happens seldom!

This was the story of my first trip to null,<br>
thanks for the 5years and counting.. My time here has never been dull.
