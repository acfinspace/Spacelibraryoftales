> Entry for the YC117 Pod and Planet Fiction Contest in the A Day in the Life category.


In the Beginning<br>
There was only Chaos<br>
In the Darkness<br>
Of the Void.<br>

Eons passed<br>
And then something arose<br>
That can only be described<br>
As Need.<br>

Need begat Want<br>
Want begat Strife<br>
And Strife birthed<br>
A new form.<br>

A seething mass<br>
Of conflicting desires<br>
That fed Strife bountifully,<br>
And its name was Humanity.<br>

Humanity fed Strife tears<br>
Of Joy,<br>
Of Lust,<br>
And Lamentation.<br>

By the end of the Beginning<br>
Humanity knew Power;<br>
And its attendants,<br>
Lust, Envy, Anger, and Revenge.<br>

Humanity indulged,<br>
Sated itself on the weaker,<br>
And no one indulged more<br>
Than the Lord Kador.<br>

Kador was by birth<br>
An inheritor of the House of Kador.<br>
Wealth, power, and near Immortality<br>
Were his.<br>

He exploited all to his advantage.<br>
Until one day, an amarrian slave trader<br>
Brought a matari woman to his house,<br>
Cinnamouan.<br>

Cinnamouan was not just beautiful,<br>
She was a shining star,<br>
Of innocence, trust,<br>
Loyalty.<br>

And Kador, who first thought of exploiting<br>
This treasure,<br>
Fell under the spell<br>
Of Love.<br>

Whether through design<br>
Or accident<br>
Of the gods,<br>
Cinnamouan quickened with child.<br>

Kador, uncharacteristically,<br>
Allowed her to keep it.<br>
When her time came,<br>
The gods took pity on her<br>

And cut short her pain,<br>
Ending her life;<br>
Leaving the child alive,<br>
To spite Kador.<br>

Kador,<br>
Who had never known<br>
Pain or Loss<br>
Or Anguish<br>

Knew all three<br>
In the hour of this child’s birth,<br>
And told its keepers to<br>
Take It Away.<br>

Thus Cinnamarr was born<br>
Into this world,<br>
Not with tears of joy,<br>
But of loss and frustration.<br>

Kador took his temper<br>
Out on Solitude.<br>
He gained famed.<br>
He cared not.<br>

A man haunted<br>
By Loss<br>
Cares<br>
Not.<br>

Not for himself,<br>
Not for others,<br>
Nor for the Future.<br>
He simply cares not.<br>

Time passed.<br>
His heir, and inheritor,<br>
Grew out of hand<br>
Without Kador’s guidance.<br>

So Kador<br>
Came home,<br>
To put his house<br>
In order.<br>

His first image<br>
Of his son<br>
Was his son<br>
With a woman-child,<br>

Somehow the<br>
Very image of Cinnamouan,<br>
Yet surpassing his lost lover<br>
In every Grace.<br>

Kador knew Rage.<br>
His son would not have<br>
Something finer<br>
Than the father had possessed.<br>

So he sent the child,<br>
His child,<br>
Whose name he did not even know,<br>
Away.<br>

Thus Cinnamarr<br>
Was cast out<br>
Into the world<br>
Alone.<br>

But Kador’s son<br>
Was a true son of his father,<br>
And arranged a covert escort, and<br>
Future for his beloved.<br>

Kador learning of this treachery<br>
Sent assassins<br>
To kill<br>
His child with Cinnamouan.<br>

The assassins met<br>
Cinnamarr’s transport<br>
Outside Caldari space<br>
And attacked.<br>

A young miner,<br>
Named Kane,<br>
Was nearby in a fleet and<br>
Witnessed this assault.<br>

With no thought to himself, or<br>
His companions, he used his venture<br>
To bump the pirates’ vessel<br>
Out of range.<br>

His fellow miners fled, leaving him,<br>
And the survivor of the attack to face the pirates<br>
Alone. They were not killed.<br>
Kane and Cinnamarr were captured.<br>

Cinnamarr was perfection,<br>
Without fault, and the pirates<br>
Quarreled over her<br>
Dispensation.<br>

Some wanting to sample<br>
The wares before her sale,<br>
While others argued against,<br>
Knowing spoiled goods bring lower prices.<br>

Cinnamarr fed these arguments. For<br>
She, too, was a child of Kador<br>
And had learned well<br>
In her father’s house.<br>

When her moment was ripe,<br>
She fed the pirates’ frenzy<br>
And they fell one upon another<br>
Until all died.<br>

Kane, she released in gratitude,<br>
Knowing full well had he not<br>
Stopped the pirates’ ship<br>
She would have perished in the cold of space.<br>

“Are they all dead?” he asked her.<br>
She nodded.<br>
“Who’s flying the ship?”<br>
“I don’t know,” she replied.<br>

Kane cataloged their resources.<br>
They had the clothes on their back,<br>
And the pirates’ vessel.<br>
A pirate ship.<br>

“I’m taking us to Thera,” he announced.<br>
“Thera?”<br>
“Thera,” he said, in a tone<br>
That brooked no argument.<br>

“Thera,” Cinnamarr repeated.<br>
She nodded once and fell silent.<br>
At Thera, she would meet her fate<br>
And future. She knew it in her bones.<br>

While Cinnamarr, was her father’s child,<br>
Kane could have been the child of her mother.<br>
He was kind, courteous, and patient.<br>
He asked nothing of Cinnamarr she was unwilling to give.<br>

Kane, she gave<br>
Those treasures she valued most,<br>
Her trust, her friendship,<br>
And her loyalty.<br>

Kane paid her back,<br>
Presenting her half the isk<br>
From the sale of the ship<br>
And it’s goods.<br>

“Be safe,” he told her. “Be good.”<br>
“Be good? Be serious, Kane, with my looks? In this place?<br>
“Goodness is probably not in my future” she replied, with a laugh.<br>
Kane smiled down at her.<br>

“Then be good at whatever you do.”<br>
He ruffled her hair,<br>
Smiled once, and strode off.<br>
“I’ll be forever grateful,” she whispered.<br>

Cinnamarr flourished in New Eden.<br>
Having a quick mind, and lush body,<br>
She determined using both<br>
Would prosper her well.<br>

It did.<br>
She opened pleasure houses,<br>
Where conversation was as valued<br>
As flesh.<br>

Where secrets were commodities,<br>
And isk simply a means<br>
Of keeping<br>
Score.<br>

But in time, Cinnamarr<br>
Met<br>
Her<br>
Match.<br>

His name was James,<br>
The scion of a Caldari<br>
Trading house,<br>
The unequaled star of his family.<br>

They met,<br>
Schemed,<br>
Joined flesh<br>
And fell in love.<br>

Then a brighter star,<br>
Called Caroline’s,<br>
Appeared on their horizon,<br>
And Kane returned.<br>

Cinnamarr saw him first<br>
And left James’ side,<br>
Rushing to Kane,<br>
A smile lighting her face like a nova.<br>

“Kaneeeee!!!!!”<br>
“Cinnamarr!”<br>
Kane swept her up in his arms,<br>
And James split with jealousy.<br>

James saw this tall blond Amarrian<br>
Standing before him, saw<br>
HIS woman cradled by this man’s arms<br>
And knew hate.<br>

Black, strong, death dealing<br>
Hate.<br>
Crooking a finger, he sealed Kane’s fate.<br>
“Take care of HIM,” James murmured.<br>

The servitor at James side, nodded,<br>
Once.<br>
Kane<br>
Would go to Oubliette.<br>

When Kane woke,<br>
He woke to Darkness,<br>
Damp,<br>
And the sound of grown men weeping.<br>

“What is this place?” Kane murmured.<br>
A guard lit a match, and answered,<br>
“Hell.<br>
“And you’re on the menu.”<br>

Cinnamarr had employees,<br>
Attendants, debtors, and<br>
Those who wished to be owed.<br>
It was one of those that came forward.<br>

“What do mean he was taken?<br>
“Who took him?<br>
“When?<br>
“Where?”<br>

“Tell me.<br>
“Isk?<br>
“Favors?<br>
“Flesh?”<br>

“Name your price.<br>
“And you shall have it.<br>
“For I will know.”<br>
I will know.<br>

So Cinnamarr learned her lover<br>
Had sent her friend<br>
To a house of forgetting;<br>
And lost her mind.<br>

“Who are you?” the prison governor asked.<br>
A laugh like soft chimes pealed out,<br>
“Call me….Erotica,”<br>
The woman answered, with a lazy smile.<br>

“Erotica?<br>
“Well…Erotica, the man you seek<br>
“Has been here for three months.”<br>
‘I’m aware of that.”<br>

“He’s here<br>
“Because of me.<br>
“I came to see his punishment.<br>
“First hand.”<br>

“Well, well,” the governor replied.<br>
“I’m sure we can work….something out.”<br>
“Do not look above your station, Governor,<br>
“Remember, well, who sent Kane here<br>

“And why.”<br>
The governor bit his lip. The rich were…..<br>
“As you wish, Madam.” At the ‘madam’ more peals of laughter<br>
Poured out.<br>

“Kane?<br>
“Kane?<br>
“Can you answer me?” the voice whispered.<br>
“Cinnamarr?” Kane answered.<br>

“I’ve not much time, Kane.”<br>
“Cinnamarr?” Kane’s voice strengthened.<br>
“Yes, it’s me. I’ve come to get you out.”<br>
“You can’t, I’ve…my clone…is tied to this place.”<br>

“It was.<br>
“It isn’t any longer.”<br>
And Kane took his chain,<br>
And broke his own neck.<br>

Cinnamarr/Erotica smiled.<br>
Put her ring to her lips,<br>
Swallowed.<br>
The poison killed the body before it hit the floor.<br>

“Cinnamarr!” Kane bellowed from the clone vat.<br>
“It’s alright, it’s alright Kane.<br>
“You’re here. With me.<br>
“It’s alright.”<br>

“Is he?”<br>
“Just passed out, mistress.<br>
“His physical injuries are gone.”<br>
“The mental ones?” she asked.<br>

“I know,” Cinnamarr whispered.<br>
“Will take time.”<br>
Will….take time.<br>
Will….take….time.<br>

The House of Forgetting<br>
Was a special purpose prison<br>
Where prisoners were not fed.<br>
Oh, oh they could eat<br>

If they chose to do so,<br>
But only upon the flesh<br>
Of those<br>
They killed.<br>

Once dead, the deceased<br>
Were cloned, and<br>
Given the choice, again,<br>
To die by starvation or to fight a fellow<br>
And feed.<br>

Initially, Kane starved<br>
And starved again,<br>
And again,<br>
And again.<br>

For three months, he starved,<br>
Less than a day before<br>
Salvation came for him<br>
He had chosen<br>

To feed.<br>
Less than<br>
Twenty-four<br>
Hours.<br>

Cinnamarr never recovered<br>
From Kane’s fate.<br>
She both hated and loved Kane<br>
As she both hated and loved James.<br>

But in the end<br>
Hate wore Love out.<br>
She began throwing lavish entertainments<br>
In her pleasure palaces.<br>

Bonus Rooms, she called them.<br>
She invited the Greedy, the Proud,<br>
The Self-Important to participate.<br>
Those who wished to feast<br>


Upon the misery of others, came.<br>
In time, they were called the Tear Collectors.<br>
James was appalled.<br>
Cinnamarr laughed at him.<br>

They quarreled, parted.<br>
Kissed and made up.<br>
And parted again.<br>
James blamed Kane.<br>

Kane transformed.<br>
James could not touch him.<br>
But he could punish where Kane came from,<br>
The mining colonies.<br>

James would punish miners,<br>
All miners,<br>
Because one miner, as he saw it,<br>
Had stolen the love of his life.<br>

Kane became a deadly fighter.<br>
He would never again be at another’s mercy.<br>
Nor would he allow innocents to suffer at the hands<br>
Of fools, lackwits, or the greedy.<br>

And Cinnamarr?<br>
Cinnamarr was lost to madness<br>
Until the gods took pity on her.<br>
For the gods, given time, do care<br>

For the foolish.<br>

So, here ends, the origin story<br>
Of James the 315th of his line,<br>
Erotica, the First,<br>
And Cannibal Kane.
