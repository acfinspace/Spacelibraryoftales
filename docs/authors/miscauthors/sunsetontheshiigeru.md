> Entry for the YC123 Union Day Celebrations - Short Written Works contest.


Ragged clouds drift amid the onrushing night
In the ebbing sun gossamer flaring bright
Scattered blossoms in a gloomy vastness
Darksome isles bearing silent witness

The bones of the planet raw, exposed, bleeding
Fissures glimmering, red wounds weeping
Poison and noxious flame into this ailing world
Tendrils of manâ€™s rage writ in vapors swirled

Spirits must yet wander those weeping ravines
Lost amidst the exhaust of broken dreams
The doomed heirs of a world divided
By their legacy generations shall be guided

But death and catastrophe do not rule the expanse
Alighting on crimson scars is fresh verdance
From afar beams of effervescent glow wafting
Defiant, shining pillars of new cities rising

As peace flows, soft and subtle through my veins
I lie awake, thoughts on monumental remains
In service and sacrifice, can one aspire to burn so bright
As here the Caldari yet do, through the long night?
