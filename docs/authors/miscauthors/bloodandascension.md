**Dark days<br>Circa YC104**

*Savelle*

The commotion woke her up. She got out of her bunk and looked around, even in the gloom the emptiness of the room was noticeable. The room felt cool, despite the heat of the afternoon sun. Her body was sticky with sweat. The illness had gotten her the day off, rare among slaves. She was a house slave of course, a half-breed so she deserved better treatment, she figured.  I can't be serving the Lady looking like a sweaty field slave after all.  Being nine years old she wasn't exactly all that helpful half the time anyway, because she was small and quiet they often ordered her to serve specific rooms, most of the times a guest quarter or even a hallway. Stand still and be quiet and do whatever is ordered. Simple really, on half the days she would receive training. Savelle liked training most of the time, she hated the diet though. Exercise and aesthetics were key for house slaves, after all no use having a beautiful house if the slaves don't match. The Lady often favored Savelle and her mother as it was hard to get good stock out on the fringes of Empire.

As she rubbed the sleep from her eyes she walked into the corridor, there were no doors in this section of the house. She felt filthy as her bare feet were sticking to the laminated floor. The hallway was completely empty, and brightly lit, she squinted a little until her eyes adjusted to the light as she headed towards the sanitary quarters. This was in the middle of the hall. The slave facilities were attached to the main house, although the designers were careful to keep it hidden from view, as such the main connection was a half sunken tunnel. When looking from the main house the slave quarters were only a slight hill in the gardens. This means there are no windows but it helps keep the heat down during the day giving the slaves a little respite.

By the time she reached the sanitary quarters and entered, the commotion seemed to have died down. Another female slave was taking a shower. Savelle recognized her, “Hi Mikari,” she said, “Is there something going on I heard shouting,” Mikari was normally part of the household group and in charge of entertainment. Savelle was often in her charge as she would join the entertainment group when she becomes of age. “I don't really know Savelle, the Lady was shouting about the Lord not arriving in time”. She seemed quite agitated, very unlike her. I saw her when I was walking back; I had just finished servicing one of the new arrivals.' I am sure it is nothing, she will probably just end up bossing your mother around for the day, you know how it is. Whenever the Lord does something, your mother must jump, you being the bastard and all'. 'Alright,' Savelle answered and stepped into one of the showers. Mikari looked at her worried, “If you still feel poorly I can ask the doctor to look at you, I know we aren't supposed to but the Lady won't intervene,” she said. Savelle said nothing, and finished her shower. Mikari immediately came to her with a thick towel and told her to head to the slave nursery when she was dressed. They'd want to keep an eye on her she assured Savelle.

The slave nursery was more than just a nursery, it was where they young were kept, but many of the household gathered here in off hours to eat and spend time with their children. It was considered a community meeting place, it was the only one slaves had besides the kitchen. Her mother was sitting at one of the many tables while in the back several children were being taught. Walking up to her mother Savelle realized she was holding a young infant. She didn't think she had seen it before, “Whose baby is that mom”, she said. Her mother looked at her and said, “That doesn't matter dear, the Lady just gave him to me to take care of for the day”. Savelle casually assumed she belonged to one of the field slaves, she was curious why the Lady gave her though. The Lady didn't like babies after all, since she couldn't get any. She put the thought out of her head as she started eating some leftover's from the main house. Getting sick does have its advantages after all!


*The lady*

The Lady paced back and forth. She glanced at the imperial soldier, one who openly bore the marks of the order, he who was the bearer of ill tidings. She continued reading the decrypted message.

*My love, I have failed you, I have failed God. I should have noticed, yet I never imagined the betrayal would cut so deep. My own brother is behind it all, my eternal downfall. All rests in your hand now, soon I won't be here to protect you. My last battle is upon me and soon I will be in Gods Empire. My immortality through God. My fleet is outnumbered greatly, but we will stall for time. My brother knows all, the hole divine truth, yet he spits on God. His treason knows no bounds, he is a heretic. He worships blood. All our plans are crushed. I pray to God, he will inspire you. He must be saved. The empire might fracture if we fail, we received His prophecy and so it will be our sacrifice.*

*You have my undying love,*

*Lord Arak Hilal*


*Savelle*

Halfway during her meal several other slaves entered, they appeared to be very excited. They were quietly whispering amongst themselves. Two of the slaves Savelle had never seen before, they must be field slaves, she thought. No wonder they are excited, if they are allowed in they must have done something very special. Suddenly she heard shouting down the hall. 'Help! Run, everyone run!' a woman shouted. The gathered slaves ran towards the doorway, there were no doors. One field slaves shouted. “See I told you so, I bet they'll finish us off too, either of them! We are on our own!” At that point eight guards entered the nursery. Savelle was startled, they were true Amarr! The guards and the slaves, looked at each other, unsure what to do. The standoff ended abruptly as more guards pushed into the room, in the middle of them was the Lady! She was accompanied by one of the Lords soldiers. 

Savelle looked at her mother for guidance she was shocked to see she had a look of panic in her eyes! All the children were quickly ushered to the back of the nursery and the adults were separated into one of the corners, by the direct orders of the Lady. One of the guards grabbed her mother, she was still holding the infant, the Lady walked up to her and whispered something while looking at the small child. To Savelle's shock she had tears in her eyes, her mother looked her way. She didn't say anything out loud, but she mouthed, “I love you.” Like she often did when she saw her doing chores. Suddenly panic erupted. Out of the blue one of the guards raised his laser rifle and aimed it at the slaves. The children started crying. Savelle only had eyes for her mother and the Lady though.

The guards started shooting. Orange laser fire erupting from the rifles. Screams started.

In seconds it was over and quiet again. None of the screams ever finished, they were cut short like the lives of those they belonged too. Only the children and her mother were left. Her mother started intensely into the eyes of the Lady. At the same time an high ranking soldier stepped in behind her. Savelle started a shout. “Mom, No!” but before her mother could turn around the guard already cut her throat. Her mother dropped to the ground still holding the infant, who started crying. Savelle ran to her one of the guards stopped her and threw her the ground. Savelle scrambled up and tried again. She grabbed her dying mother. A guard stepped in, but before the guard could kick her the Lady grabbed him, she then walked away confident, like nothing happened.  Savelle only had eyes for her mother. She whispered; “I love you, and I have always loved the Lord, I am sorry I did this to you”.  Savelle screamed at her, yelling;  “Stay Awake!” in a desperate panic. Silently her mother sighs, the escape of her last breath. It left Savelle alone in a room full of dead and the resonating sounds of crying children.


*Fleet Commander [name withheld]*

The Khanid fleet took positions in around the backwater planet in the Bleak Lands. The expected resistance would be minor, but all precautions had been taken. The imperial fleet that dropped traitorous troops, unknowing of their true agenda, had already jumped to another system, the backwaters were on fire. The slaves were stirring all across the empire, but here on agricultural back planets they had numbers, they outnumbered the faithful twenty to one or even more.

The uprising was in full swing, the slaves appeared to be winning even, hard to believe it was all a sideshow. He would do what was divine, anything less would be treason and worse heresy, he read the orders again his eyes lingered on the signature. "Signed, Admiral Vanazir Saracen", he spoke it aloud as to cement the reality He looked around the bridge and was determined to succeed. This was his only option for redemption. With the Emperors condition worsening, the Empire would soon be up for grabs. Now was the time to make sure the outcome would be favorable for the King. Despite everything faith would always bind them.

He gave the command and Revelation class dreadnaughts opened fire on the planet. The enemy was already on the ground, but that would no longer be to their advantage. The tactical overviews allowed him to close monitor the situation in space, however a ground offensive is inherently messy.  


*Fatih*

Explosions shook the building. Heavy fighting was mainly in the city, miles from the estate. Rampaging slaves, supported by Minmatar warriors, were fighting pitched battles for the control of key positions.

Lieutenant Fatih Al-Shah ducked as several projectiles hit the building left of him. He couldn't believe what he was seeing. This was no mere slave uprising, this was a full rebellion. This was full scale war! They intent to take the planet! His troops were quickly losing positions across the city. He reached for his commset, 'Who ordered this withdrawal, we need to keep the bridges until we can evacuate the remaining civilians!' he furiously shouted on comms. 'Answer me! Who is still in his position, I will not accept cowardice', his comm set remained quiet.
Shouts went up in the street behind him. Multiple wounded soldiers stumbled into his field of view. Several of his command group rushed to provide aid. The wounded soldiers were shouting and gesturing. The realization hit him, if there are wounded behind and the comms remained quiet...

He had already lost this battle. His flanking positions must all be overrun. It must have happened too quick to call in reinforcements, or communications must have been jammed. Holder families were still evacuating, those filthy slaves will surely butcher anyone cut off from the space port.

He send out a plea for reinforcements to planetary command, to his dismay he merely received a a single sentence in reply, announcing him that all units were on the lines already and that he had no option than to withdraw his troops to a final stand at the space port. They will lose the planet.


*The colonel*

The colonel put down his mug on the solid wooden table, gripping it with both hands and enjoying the sturdy natural feeling, such a change from the plastic and metal in space.<br>He gazed absently over the map. “Unexpected resistance, colonel” the warrior informed him. “We have taken the most of the western farms in a swift advance, most of the holders have been unable to execute their slave stocks. That is thousands of people saved! Local knowledge on farm layout and security staffing has increased our efficiency considerably, we have managed to bypass several local ambushes”, the warrior pointed out on the map. This planet was ill equipped to deal with any emergency situations,' he continued.

A silence fell, the Colonel signaled he should continue his update. “As I said Sir, unexpected resistance, clearly off-world. Sir? Uhm, more disturbing Sir,” he stammered. “The Amarr seem to be fighting each other as of yet we have been unable to identify who and why they are fighting.” The soldier started explaining how the main fighting appeared to be centered around a very large estate just south of the largest city on the continent. Its owner has clearly considered a siege on the estate might happen. The defenses are formidable and there have been multiple indications that Tetrimon cultists are involved.

The colonel looked clearly worried and subsequently ordered his troops re-deploy south. Whatever it was that have the Amarr fighting amongst themselves for, it would be his.


*Fatih*

There is an Amarr fleet in orbit, unbelievable. Wait, not an Amarr fleet it is Khanid. A Khanid fleet. The Fatih ordered the young officer to spread the word. Salvation was here, the fleet will provide heavy aerial support. The Minmatar rabble would quickly be forced to abandon any thought of engaging the port. Fatih smiled to himself, the young officer looked at him with uncertainty, thinking he'd gone mad. Within seconds, however large blasts started ripping through enemy positions. He quickly ordered his comms officer to relay the order to keep their heads down until the bombardments lessened. Their priority would be the Holder evacuation.


*Khalar*

A new missile impact tore a hole in the outer wall beside the gate of the northern entrance.  The last of his Tetrimon elite troops were still a hundred meters away from reaching the inner wall entrance. Khalar, known to his troops as Mezagrom, urged his troops to provide cover fire. Fivehundred meters up ahead he could see the first imperial troops pass through the hole. A second passed before he fired his laser rifle, that moment of doubt, he wondered; “Do they know they are following blood raider orders?” Surely they must, a true imperial soldier would question such orders. To attack a fellow Amarrian while Minmatar slaves rampaged through the countryside. He felt his hand clam up just thinking about it, it made him furious.

He shook the idea from head and saw the first of the traitorous troops were already being cut down by defensive fire. His troops were holding out, he knew backup must be on the way. It was a matter of time. Meanwhile the first of the aerial bombardments started raining down on the planet, creating a beautiful glow in the sky during the days fading light. The city was on fire and on his command the bombardment of blood raider loyalists was beginning. God's vengeance would soon be upon them.


*Kuntac*

Silently they crawled through the field. His khumaak by his side and a sturdy gun on his back, Kuntac slowly inched forward. The guards hadn't noticed him yet, or any of his brothers. The scent of grass was filling his nose, and the fertile dirt on his hands.  There were only ten of them on this part of the perimeter. Fifteen meters to go, so close, so close. One of the guards turned around, scanned the field scanning the field with a hurried frightened glance. The gunfire up ahead intensified. Kuntac wondered which side was winning. The attackers clearly outnumbered them the defenders ten to one, not to mention all the heavy assets. He was convinced the defenders would lose eventually, despite the formidable defensive features of the compound.

His own position, now only five meters from the first guard was testament to that. He waited for the last of his brothers to get into position. He hooked his khumaak to his on his side, making sure the leather would prevent any noises. He would do this silently, no time for showmanship. He unsheathed his knife, a simple one, utilitarian, but sharp.

Swiftly he cut the throat on the first guard, his body had barely hit the ground and he already had his khumaak unhooked. It only took a singly swing and it was embedded in the chest of the second guard. His brothers had followed his lead and all the guards were down before the alarm could be sound. Quickly dozens of armed Matari flowed from the ditches, as if appearing out of nowhere. Nearly a hundred fifty men strong, send ahead of the main force. The lands around the complex were vast, but the main slave pens were located here, between the houses inner and outer walls. The Matari force quickly scaled walls and split up, half made a dash for the inner wall. Shrieks from the automated alarm systems filled the air. Yet guards failed to materialize, there would be no defense of the southern walls. The inner walls were breached. Up ahead would be the slave quarters and the main house. The first warriors entered the complex.


*Khalar*

The alarms went up, a breach of the estates defenses! Khalar tapped two of his men on the shoulders and withdrew from the wall. His commanding officer came bounding up the small embankment the wall was build on. He looked panicked. He yelled something but Khalar couldn't hear him over de sounds of battles and the wailing alarms. “Deacon, the southern wall has been breached,” he yelled.  “They are already in the building. They aren't slaves they are trained professionals, organized terrorists. Off-worlders.” Khalar quickly ordered the half his troops to abandon the wall, he feared that in the next attack might lose the wall. It might not matter though. He hoped orbital support might delay the next blood raider assault.


*Fleet Commander [name withheld]*<br>
**Adressed to the council of His Royal Highess.<br>Report #43495 [location classified]**


We have established contact with local imperial forces. After some initial distrust a solid relation was formed with a Lieutenant Fatih Al-Shah. Who in absence of superiors organized an effective retreat towards the main cities spaceport. 

Planetary forces were wholly inadequate.  Most of the imperial officers neglected their duty to the emperor in favor to the Holders that employed them. As a result imperial forces stood isolated as soldiers teamed up with local guards to defend individual estates over strategic planetary assets or cities. Behavior tantamount to high treason, we have specific instances where Holders ordered those under their command to neglect duty to their emperor. If these Holders would have fallen under Khanid jurisdiction I would have them prosecuted. As it is no affair of the King we have assisted were possible, yet not meddled in Imperial internal affairs.

Upon request orbital support was given around the main cities space port as the fleet was in a holding position above the Hilal estate. The decision was made not commit ground troops in support of the evacuation. **[Addition #35.5]** documents complaints from Holders upon a denial of assistance as per order #withheld. The planet estate losses should be considered full, personal losses are, but not limited to, minor Holder families, staff and slave stock. The local theological commission has successfully secured all key artifacts. The church financial losses are severe, but no loss of life has been reported.

*Kuntac*

He held his breath and waited. He closed his eyes and slowly let his let air escape from his chest. The explosion didn't happen. Kuntac held is back to the cold steel wall of slave complex. The grenade he had just thrown around the corner had failed to detonate. He glanced around the corner; the plasma grenade had bounced from the wall, still slowly spinning around. The soldiers had withdrawn into one of the chambers. He waited another second, either attack now and risk his troops or face a well barricaded opponent. He cursed on his breath, wishing he knew the layout. Usually slave quarters didn't have multiple exits. They hadn't captured anyone alive so far, all the Matari they had found had been executed, all Amarr had though had fought to the death. Amarrian servants had taken their own lives, preferring the easy way out. Which meant that whoever was still in there would probably fight to the death. He looked again, an eerie silence had fallen, the grenade was still there. He grabbed a new one and tossed it towards the other. Better safe than sorry.

Again he held his breath. This time an explosion shook the steel wall behind him. Hot air blasted past his face, he held his eyes shut. The heat scorching him, he smelled his own singed hair. He mustered his courage and charged. He didn't look behind to see if his brothers followed, he knew they were there. The explosion had ripped the steel walls, the intense heat melting steel like it was plastic. This was the moment. He jumped into the first chamber. Prepared for anything.  Almost.


*Savelle*

She held her mother, blood covered her hands. Her mother’s dress was soaked and a small puddle formed on the cold floor. It started soak her dress. The small child was still clutched in her mother’s hands, the he didn't cry at all. He was silent, yet alert, tightly holding on to his mothers hands. Slowly the fog that covered her reason started to lift, she began to become aware of her surroundings. She heard guards shouting, running through the hallway, gunshots followed. Another silence fell.

After a short pause the guards passed through the hallway past the nursery again, less this time. The lady with them, they would be closed in, locked in, stuck in one of sleeping quarters. Something bounced past her in the hallway. “tick…tick”, metal on metal. She filled with dread, now they would all die. She closed her eyes and held her mother closely. A small whimper escaped from the small child, he felt his little hand touching her face. Again silence commenced. The other children huddled together in the corner.

A loud explosion followed.

Savelle held her breath. Her ears were buzzing, the room filled with hot air. It blasted over her. She huddled even closer to her mother. The child started crying in fear. When she looked over to the other kids, she thought they were screaming. She didn't hear them though. One of them pointed to the doorway.<br>A shadow fell over her, as she turned around a large, brutish looking man stood over her. She wondered if she should be scared. She felt nothing however.


*Kuntac*

He picked up the small girl. She struggled meekly, groping for her dead mother. Then he noticed the small child, a mere babe. He signaled his brothers. He turned around, a blood covered girl clinging to his neck. He looked her in the eyes, for a second he thought he saw a glimmer but then all he saw was a blank empty stare Her eyes were hard, cold not those of a small girl. She didn't cry, not a sound. He walked away from the site of a massacre. Every brother he encountered on his way out was speechless.

The Colonel told him that the Holder was off-world. His wife had chosen to go down with the estate. Fighting was still on-going. The house seemed to have been defended by Amarrian cultists. No one knew why they were here. Matari forces had searched the main house quickly, but nothing of apparent importance had been found. The wife had hidden in the slave quarters instead of a safe room or the like. Odd, but she carried nothing of importance. They secured and took whatever they could.<br>The defenders had blown up the mainframe, but they had managed to salvage some data. Analysts would have to look it over. The fighting was still ongoing as the full force of the Minmatar forces had yet to arrive. The decision to abandon the estate was made after realizing they could probably not hold off the Amarrians and escort the children out. The news of incoming reinforcements cemented that decision.<br>Kuntac looked to the sky, hostile dropships were approaching. The child stared to the sky holding him tightly as she left the estate for the first time of her life.

*Khalar*

His men looked at him. They couldn't believe seeing the Deacon swear. It amused him, how they called him Mezagrom, how they all looked up to him. Despite it all he never felt blessed and wasn't all so sure he was the one the prophecy mentioned. He never believed it, now he was certain. He had lost the child; the prophecy had never made sense to him anyway. He was supposedly the guardian the orphan from Mezagrom. He didn't remember his early years that clearly, he grew up in with the Tetrimon. It was all he knew. They told him he was special the day of he came of age. He was already popular so he didn't care and assumed it had to do with being the most gifted of the pupils. Unfortunately he had been very wrong. He had read the prophecy since then, the others didn't know of course, but he knew the guardian wasn't mentioned until the child was nine. He was frustrated, worst case he'd have to spend the next nine years searching.

He watched his troops board the ships, the Matari were nearby, but not eager to engage. They were happy to stay clear for now. They'd have their planet and were not in a hurry to die by orbital bombardment. The estate was still smoldering in the background. The dead had been gathered, except those fighting for the blood raiders. He would leave them for the Matari, manual labor is what they were good for.<br>He grabbed the dirt, smelled it and put it in his pocket. He would be back, he knew that for sure. He stepped aboard the plane, making sure he was the last one to leave.

**So it begins**
