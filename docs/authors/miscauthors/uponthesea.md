Upon the sea<br>
the wind blows<br>
catching my sails (my spirit!)<br>
billowing them before me<br>
as I fly upon the waves<br>
which spray my face<br>
with little droplets<br>
that the sun kindly dabs away

Upon the sea<br>
away from land<br>
I am so free<br>
so free to be<br>
blown by the wind (blown by *God*)<br>
as I lift my face, exultant<br>
kissed by wind and sun and sea<br>
*kissed by God*
