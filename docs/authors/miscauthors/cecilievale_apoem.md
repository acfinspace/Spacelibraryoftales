# A Poem

> Author: Cecilie Vale

> Original post: [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/yc123-union-day-celebrations-short-written-works-contest/325391/](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/yc123-union-day-celebrations-short-written-works-contest/325391/)

> Author’s Note: A poem, reflecting how emotions must be held in check, and how difficult it can be to conform to a cultural standard thrust upon you. Of comrades lost in battles. Of unrequited love. A glimpse into the difficulty of Caldari life.

> Entry for the YC123 Union Day Celebrations - Short Written Works contest.


Alone with my thoughts<br>
Pondering our goodbye.<br>
Few words in hushed tones.<br>
Do not cry, you tell yourself.<br>

Walk away.<br>
Look back once more,<br>
But you’re gone.<br>

Soundless tears flow freely<br>
Mingling with the soft rain.<br>
How fitting.<br>
The heavens are crying with you.<br>
Emulating your pain.<br>

This is not farewell.<br>
We will meet again<br>
Even if it feels like forever.<br>

Until then, I’ll hold it all in<br>
And cry when I’m again<br>
Alone with my thoughts.<br>
