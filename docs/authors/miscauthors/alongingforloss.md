"There is an Archon tackled!" a voice screamed over comms echoing through the entire ship.

I was under one of the bastion couplings making sure that everything was still holding together. I got knocked around a little the last time I went out in the old bird. I didn't realize that I had left the communications array on so loud. Startled, I lurched upwards slamming my head against the plating in the the confined crawlspace.

"Motherfu.." I reached for my work rag and checked for blood while walking over to the comms panel nearby.

"Anyone there?!?" the voice cried out again " There is an Archon tackled!"

"Who's tackled? Friendly or hostile?" I asked curiously while running my communications identity log to verify the transmission and sender.

"I am..." The voice again being ever so forthcoming with information.

The report came back. He was one of ours, a newer member to our Corporation, Billy Stevens.

"Where are you?" I went from annoyed to concerned almost instantaneously. "How many are there, and are you holding?

"About nine of them, they can't break me they are in tech two frigs. I am in PBD" he said with a little more confidence as he realized that he had more time than he originally thought.

When you are reading up on the news of the day, half paying attention to the goings on and then suddenly realizing that you are surrounded by enemy ships, this can be both a jarring, and fear inducing experience.

"Alright buddy hang tight we will be right there." I said calmly to help reassure him. I switched the comms channel over to the interior of the station. "Hey guys Rusty Boon here, did anyone else happen to be tuned into the Intel channel and overhear what is happening?" I asked while remotely inputting the coordinates into my ships computer then started heading rapidly towards my control pod.

The Corporation Leader of xX-Crusader-Xx, Dante Lobos, responded immediately "No we've been busy looking at kitten videos on the Scope Leisure site in my quarters. What's up?"

"That new guy Billy is tackled in a Carrier in PBD, about 10 T2 frigs he is holding strong. Let's Roll" I strapped myself in.
The pod fluid began to fill and the HUD lights up and a in a warm soft reddish glow in front of me It displayed a systems powerup showing my Paladin class Marauder. The interface link between my mind and ship now fully in tune with eachother. A message comes in from my ships computer in a seductive female voice. "Virginity Online".

Paul Sullivan was the next to chime in "We can take the Jumpbridge and be there in no time."

"Hate Crime, Run ahead of us and throw a bubble on those asshats" Paul said in an almost melodic tone.

"We taking our toys?" Dante asked jokingly already knowing the answer.

"I'm already strapped in and undocking" I chuckled as I started clearing the outer docking ring.

A fleet was formed and all of us now were now undocked and aligned. Hate Crime's Devoter shot off ahead of us towards the Jump bridge to tackle the enemy fleet. Surveying what we were taking made all of us laugh. The fleet consisted of 3 Marauders, a Golem, a Kronos, and my Paladin. We had also a few others with us in a Proteus, Cerberus, and a Lachesis. A warp was Issued and we all blinked out of sight off the station towards our destination. 3 minutes had passed since the Initial Intel.

"How you holding up buddy?" I asked Billy, who had now joined us in fleet.

" I think they are getting bored and realizing that they can't break my tank." He replied with a depressed tone.

"Turn off your reppers for a little bit, make them think that they have a chance." I chuckled back at him. All of us were now jumping through the bridge, we were only 2 gates away.

Hate Crime called out over comms "I am jumping into system with Billy now, will have a bubble up shortly, I wish I could see the look on their faces when you all come in".

We were all now warping towards the final gate before enemy contact.

If you haven't guessed yet, it is not normal to bring Marauders to a frigate fight. Although we get bored easily and have to suppress this boredom with what some would consider reckless stupidity. We call it something else... an innovative use of excess assets.

"Bubble is up!" Hate shouted with the pride of a toddler taking his first steps. "Come on in boys the water feels great".

Dante issued the next command "All jump in, warp to Hate, weapons free" His confidence resounded through all of our communications arrays.

"Woohoo, get these Fucks " Billy Cheered

The last gate upon us we jumped through and began warping to Hate. Smaller ships taking off first, then the big boys. We landed on field in what I would consider a career change moment in the hearts and minds of our now reluctant targets.

Paul called out over comms with an almost sadistic tone "Bastion Green".

The enemy on field was Mordus Angels. They quite frequently roam through our space looking for easy targets. In the past though they have been reprimanded by their leadership, for using ships that are over a certain isk value. This leaves them with few but still effective options to play with. They are a respectable but yet still stubborn group that continually returns. They started their night off on a high point. I mean you have to give them some credit. They did tackle a lone ratting carrier. This would make any small gang happy. I am sure that in the past 5 minutes this went from a moment of preemptive victory and celebration, to the onset of medically treatable depression.

In less than a minute it they were down more than half of their fleet that was not able to clear the bubbles, while the ones who did escape sat off on a safe perch watching their comrades die to an overkill response fleet.

I aligned up to the perching fleet and activated my micro jump drive, Landing just out of range of being able to take out more of them. They then retreated out of system.

Paul called out again "Bastion Red"

The others with me all celebrated and chatted about the fight. I stayed quiet and stared off into the vastness of space.

After a short while I let slip an audible sigh over comms.

"What's wrong Rusty?" Paul asked concerned.

"I thought tonight was going to be Prom Night" I muttered.

"Prom Night?" Billy asked puzzled.

Dante laughed and responded almost immediately "It's the night every boy longs for, its the night he is supposed to lose his Virginity"
