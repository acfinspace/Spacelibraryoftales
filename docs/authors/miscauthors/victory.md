> Entry for the YC123 Union Day Celebrations - Short Written Works contest.

Sabre wings beating to the rise and fall<br>
Of a falcon between the peaks of Home<br>
Mountain Wind whispers, listen to its call<br>
Child of forest and the sea where you roam<br>

To distant lands or stars in the sky above<br>
Do not forget the lessons of the snow<br>
When our people gathered with those they love<br>
Together as one where their strength would grow<br>

To prevail, endure the storms when they come<br>
Unbroken, unafraid of the tumult<br>
We meet trials of fate with brave hearts that drum<br>
Marching forward to victoryâ€™s result<br>
