You helped us out when we were rookies<br>
Unsure what to do or how to play<br>
You said you would come and guide us<br>
Because you were only one jump away

We became corpmates, allies and friends<br>
Finding challenge and success among the stars<br>
You were always there to share our journey<br>
Because we were only ever one jump apart

As we undock we still expect to see you near us<br>
A capsuleer with whom we grew and flew<br>
No matter what we needed or when<br>
You were always somehow ‘passing through’

We honour you as you honoured us<br>
We celebrate the great gift of knowing you<br>
You go now where we will one day follow<br>
Some day we’ll take that last jump too
