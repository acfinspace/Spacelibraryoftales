Some may fear what the past has buried, yet I remain and fear<br>
is my weapon.<br>
I am the straight line now. Dreams give cursed call – give resonance of stones found purchase which<br>
speed cannot shake.<br>
Betrayal awakens. The cast bird gives me peace and blessing<br>
to recover.<br>
Axios! Axios! Brothers and Sisters! Select of yourself what has<br>
always been true.<br>
Held up to Amarr, let any fissures sound. Past will revelate and calibrate truth. It will lock and<br>
you shall strike through.<br>
They needed more. They needed truth held tightly in curved beaks. They needed us<br>
to recover.<br>
