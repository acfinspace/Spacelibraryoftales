"God of mercy, hear our plea,<br>
Grant us strength and victory.<br>
Guide us with your holy light,<br>
Through the darkness of the fight.

Bless our weapons, bless our fleet,<br>
Make our enemies know defeat.<br>
Protect our comrades, keep them safe,<br>
As we go forth in your grace.

We fight to serve, to glorify,<br>
With courage and honor, we’ll never die.

Amarr Victor"<br>
