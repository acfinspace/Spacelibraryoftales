We are flying. Above the water.<br>
Behold my broken wings.<br>
We’re swimming. Beneath the surface.<br>
Behold my fragile lungs.<br>
We are walking. Through the weather.<br>
Beware my damaged husk.<br>
We are crawling. Right by the mountains.<br>
Beware their rocks are turning away.

Above the water. We are flying.<br>
I need these broken wings.<br>
Underneath surface. We are swimming.<br>
I need these feeble lungs.<br>
Right through the weather. We are walking.<br>
I need this damaged hide.<br>
By the mountains. We are crawling.<br>
The rocks are turning away now.
