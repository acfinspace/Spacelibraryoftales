She stood at attention, straight as a steel bar, immaculate dark blue uniform, boots gleaming.

The light was blinding and she hardly saw anything of the silent room past the stage she was standing on. She could hear the silence split by the booming voice of the speaker.
The high ranking Navy official was speaking on a podium at the end of the row of military personnel. He spoke about the State… about how much they had achieved in so little time… he spoke about defending the values of the Caldari State… about the service all those who were in the Navy did in the defence of the State… about the dangers and enemies the Navy faced every day… about how proud the State should be of them, of the Navy, for their outstanding work.
"These people fought for the State! They risked their life for the State! They put their hearts and minds toward the defence of our values, of our STATE!" the words boomed and the tail end was drown into the thunderous applause.

“We are here today to reward some of those personnel, some of those people that had been doing their best out there, in space, for away from their homes but with the State in their heart.”

“FOR THE STATE!” as on clue the few rows of Navy personnel boomed their salute and rose their hands to their eyebrow in unison, sharp and precise, because the Navy was one: it did not matter you were a Deteis, a Civire or an Achura, once you joined the Navy, you were the Navy.

The salute was met with another round of thunderous applause and the high ranking official let it die before he stepped down from the podium. A military aide was right there, ready to trail him as he started on the row.
The military aide carried a metal tray full of medals and followed the high ranking official just one step behind, never missing a step, never moving more than what was exactly needed. Each time the Navy official stepped in front of a Navy soldier, he would turn to pick up one of the medals and appoint it on their chest. A few words were whispered and the soldier would salute before the high ranking official moved on.

She did not move an inch, she did not let the lights from above glare her to the point of wincing, she did not let the warmness make her sweat. This was one of those moment on which an entire career hinged, where months long efforts were rewarded.

With the corner of her eye, she saw the high ranking official just one soldier before her and soon enough, he walked in front of her. Her eyes did not move away from the officer’s face, she only caught at the edges of her view the medal for her service moving, reaching her chest, being appointed, adding the smallest of weights to the left side of her chest.

"A medal for your efforts in support of the Caldari State, soldier. The State thank you, be proud of what you’ve accomplished."

The high ranking official words were military perfect, with just a smile warming up the otherwise cold and calculating visage; you did not get in those position without growing cold and calculating.

“Thank you, Sir!” she replied, sharp as metal as she saluted just as sharply. The high ranking official nodded approvingly and moved on to the next in row.

She was having a hard time not beaming with proudness; just a few years ago she would not have even thought she was going to be standing there, being awarded a medal for her service to the Caldari Navy. However, a true soldier of the Caldari State would not let emotions get through until the ceremony was done.

The medal award ceremony kept on going as she steeled herself and remained standing. Only when every single soldier standing on the stage had been decorated and the high ranking official had moved back to the podium, it continued.

“Praise this people because they are the Navy and their efforts keep us all safe. FOR THE STATE!” the soldiers boomed in unison with the high ranking official on those last words “FOR THE STATE!”.

What they did out there was for the State, to defend it and its values, as much as to defend their dear ones back home. They could accomplish things that many would have said to be impossible, but for them, they were not, because they were the Caldari Navy.

“FOR THE STATE!”
