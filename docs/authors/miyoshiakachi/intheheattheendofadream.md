Heat, too much heat.

A tear tried to fall, only to be vaporized by the increasing hotness of the air.

They were just people. They did nothing other then wanting to try settle a new planet, other than wanting to start a new life.

Another tear fall and disappeared.

They made them believe, they mentioned the risks, but they praised far more the gains of this all. When in truth, they didn’t care for them at all.

Outside the window she saw one of the other freighters burning, in its last moments, scattered escape pods flying away from it.

And then, they didn’t care, they just saw three cargo ships, they just saw the easy prey in them. They could pride themselves to have killed three freighters today. Great achievement! But freighters are unarmed. They had been told their mission, the fact they were just settlers, but they didn’t listened.

For them they were just another kill.

Shriek of metal and the air heated up even more. She couldn’t move, she could just stare outside, her life crumbling to pieces, with her hopes and dreams. She just wanted to find peace now. Nothing more mattered.

On that freighter there was all her life, her family and friends, her memories and thoughts. No one will remember her or her fellows. They will just float in the void of space, away from everyone and everything, away from their home.

Her mind was empty, she knew she should try to escape, to live, but with these three ships, a part of her was dying. She didn’t even feel remorse for the wrong choice, or anger toward the ones that brought them there, or towards the ones killing them. There is only growing, cold, void.

But that void will bring peace, will bring coolness after the unbearable heat.



The freighter exploded, bright and hot, and finally, there was peace. No more ships or drones flying around, just frozen bodies floating between the metal debris of a dream.

A face stares, framed by long frozen black hairs, she is not accusing, or questioning, she is no more here, she is in peace now.
