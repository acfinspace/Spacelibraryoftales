# Impossible Love, the new bestseller by Cialette Ahubbert is out! 

> Author: Miyoshi Akachi

> Original post:

> Author’s Note: I wanted to try a pair of things: first, doing something “out of the comfort zone”; second, something different from “usual kind” of news that are created.<br>I believe that even in a setting as advanced as New Eden there would still be books and written works and if there are those, then there is a certain kind, satisfying a market niche.<br>For the purpose of the advertisement, I created a “New Eden Goodreads” which practically is our Goodreads.<br>Albeit I’m sure you want to read it, no I don’t plan to write the whole book, yes it is between two ships and yes it is in Thera.

So strong… so close…
