# A Haiku Collection 2

**On a lone voyage**

Lone cruising in space<br>
Thinking on past, on future<br>
Mind wanders away
 
**On the wanderers**

Space is emptiness<br>
The wandering soul seeks light<br>
A star is distant
 
**On the battle**

The fight was fiery<br>
Cries of death echoed through space<br>
Wrecks rest peacefully
