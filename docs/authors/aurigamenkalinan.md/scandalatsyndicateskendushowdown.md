**Scandal at Syndicate’s Kendu Showdown!**

Acrimony over the use of ringers in amateur kendu leagues surfaced in a post match interview after Ishukone Devils defeated ISP Goals on Sunday in the Men’s Grade B Grand Final (Syndicate Kendu League) - see full match report here.

The Devils were led to victory by former Sajha Mavericks player and all-star Lance Drake Mandrell. The use of former professional players by amateur teams is a subject of increasingly heated debate amongst fans and commentators alike. This strength of feeling was on show at the Goals’ press conference, with ISP player Auriga Menkalinan apparently calling into question The Devils’ integrity.

*A short video segment is embedded. It shows a tired looking man standing against a canvas of sponsors’ logos. The competing voices of reporters can be heard out of view.*

Reporter: “So close, bad luck! How do you feel?”

Menkalinan: “I’m not sure it was! The momentum changed back and forth. We had some good spells in the second and fourth seasons but they got on top from the start so we were always playing catch up and, after that third season… well, it was too big an ask.”

Reporter: “They really took it away from you in Marut.”

Menkalinan: “Yes, we tried but … well, Lance is such a fantastic player… we just couldn’t contain him.”

Reporter: “How do you feel about former pros like him playing in the Grade B competition?”

*There follows a pause while Menkalinan visibly bites back a sharp retort.*

Menkalinan: “Look, I’ve nothing against Lance. He’s a wonderful player and a great guy but… You know, the way kendu works, someone who understands the game like he does can really raise the level of the whole team. That’s the art of it. … So, fair play to Lance but I do sometimes wonder if the Devils’ selectors are working within the spirit of the league.”

*There is an explosion of shouted follow ups from the reporters and after a moment Menkalinan has to pick one.*

Reporter: “Mr. Menkalinan, you were recently spotted leaving CO LO in Caille. Which of their ice creams is your favourite?”

*Menkalinan nearly drops his water bottle in surprise (and maybe a little horror), after which the video is cut.*

Frustratingly, we weren’t able to ask Menkalinan to clarify what he was implying because he left the press room shortly after the interruption but it is safe to say that this debate isn’t going away any time soon!
