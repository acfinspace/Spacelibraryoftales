> Entry for YC121 New Eden Capsuleer’s Writing Contest in the Academic/Scientific/News category.


**Published in the Gallente tabloid “See and Hear” magazine on 11.03.121.**

**Make ours a Henry’s!**

Grandma’s favourite tipple, Henry & Sons Brandy, looks to be enjoying an unexpected new audience among today’s elite.

Rumours surfaced recently of the acquisition of Heuromont’s most venerable brandy house by Ars Investment, a vehicle associated with the very fabulous Miss Federation YC 120, Catherine Gillot. Since then, the previously dusty brand has been picked up by some of the hottest venues in the city, with many in Caille quickly following suit.

When we spotted capsuleer Auriga Menkalinan leaving CO LO (birthplace of Caille’s ‘fortified ice cream’ craze) accompanied by a mystery blonde (more on her when we get it people), we decided to find out what he had chosen. You guessed it, Henry’s Strawberry Blonde!

*A short video segment is embedded. It shows a tired looking man standing against a canvas of sponsors’ logos. The competing voices of reporters can be heard out of view.*

Reporter: “Mr. Menkalinan, you were recently spotted leaving CO LO in Caille. Which of their ice creams is your favourite?”

*Menkalinan nearly drops his water bottle in surprise (and perhaps a little horror) before scrambling a response.*

Menkalinan: “…What? …Oh! …Erm, strawberry with …um brandy.”

Reporter: “Nothing stronger? What kind of brandy? How was it?”

Menkalinan: “Er… Henry’s, yeah it was great. …Do you have a kendu question?”

Other Reporter: “Yeah man, what’s with the derail?!”

Kendu: quaint, authentic, refreshing - remind you of anything? So there you have it, this season’s must mix; you can thank us later!

*A large advert for Henry & Sons Brandy follows.*
