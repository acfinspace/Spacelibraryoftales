It seems not very long ago<br>
that your mind was safe as highsec,<br>
the largest freighters easily hauling<br>
memories between past and present.

At first it seemed bad luck,<br>
sometimes memories got ganked,<br>
a deep space transport getting caught<br>
at some random gate.

Then one by one the systems fell,<br>
the trusted trade routes broken,<br>
yet with increasing effort<br>
blockade runners still pass.

Today your mind is like a shattered wormhole,<br>
only the smallest ships get through,<br>
their cargo-hold barely large enough<br>
to bring scattered shards of past

Tomorrow, the heart-shaped capsule<br>
with no cargo but oneself<br>
will carry love as the last thing<br>
that can still warp from me to you.
