*Amidst the current Minmatar Offensive and the loss of Floseswin, the following audio file is trending on Nationalist Amarrian forums and Militia comm channels.*<br>
*It is a sermon from Prince Seraghis to his Militia, Task Force 641.*

**"Contest prevents atrophy."**

“The healthy numbers of our foes present us with a clear adversary who can only unite us.<br>
My friends, do not be discouraged.<br>
For an army to be strong it must always be at war, and we grow stronger every day.<br>
We have aligned rival factions as a mediator, unifying our allies against our rightful enemies.<br>
We created intelligence and communications infrastructure that will serve us not only in this war, but also the next one.<br>
Our current military stockpiles are unprecedented.<br>
More and more volunteers flock to our banner, noble heroes of all backgrounds eager to learn how to serve their Empire.<br>
My House is a poor one, but you have elevated it into such regard in these later days through valor alone.<br>
From our humble beginnings a few years ago, merely a handful of Navy Veterans and eager zealots, we have become a true army, and a valued asset to our great Empire.<br>
We have found so many treasured friends along the way, forming relationships and friendships that will last for generations.<br>
Capsuleers, Veterans, Mercenaries, Volunteers…Wealthy Lords and Humble Citizens, all of you have come here to serve your Empire.<br>
You receive little thanks and even less support from a dying Empire unwilling to continue the fight itself. You are dear to me, and I will furnish you with everything you need to succeed.<br>
This waxing conflict is the herald of a new golden era amidst stagnation.<br>
With our bare hands we will defy entropy.<br>
The lonely Trilium, Sigil of my House, has this very spring reappeared in the forests of my home.<br>
My ancient grandmother tells me it is the strongest she has ever seen this mystical flower.<br>
In this hour we unfurl our banner openly in defiance, contesting the sunset, abiding the night, and preparing for the dawn.”<br>
