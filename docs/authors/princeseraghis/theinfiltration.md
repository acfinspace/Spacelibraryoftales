# The Infiltration

> Author’s Note: The following was created by a Ni-Kunni from my household. This is not his first language, but as a mentor of mine for many years, he was moved to make the attempt, and insisted I enter this work on his behalf. It is an account of our earliest days together, when I was but a young second officer in the Imperial Navy fighting in the Bleak Lands. I took him into my own household after our Captain was slain in battle.

Behind the moon, we lay in decimation.<br>
Our once prized fleet was burning.<br>
Those who survived wept at our desolation.<br>

Across, our foes gloated in preparation,<br>
Like ants at night they scurried,<br>
Mindless carrion, seeking replication.<br>

Our Marshall wandered, seeking explanation.<br>
So many had come so far.<br>
Persist to our death? Or evacuation?<br>

Alas, from God, there was no stimulation.<br>
How had we lost his favor?<br>
How great our sins must be to earn sedation!<br>

Sleepless this night he sought for motivation.<br>
He had to save the army.<br>
And so he pondered, desperate for elation.<br>

How could he complete this purification?<br>
We had lost all advantage.<br>
Now required strategic inspiration.<br>

So on ahead he went for observation.<br>
There he would survey the front.<br>
And from the men, complete investigation.<br>

But alert they were, vexing irritation.<br>
Mourning dead, nursing grudges.<br>
Encouraged, he developed this creation:<br>

He sought to send one forward from this station,<br>
To scout the enemy lines,<br>
And for this task, he offered compensation.<br>

One alone sought this reckless innovation:<br>
Seraghis, a minor prince.<br>
But no others would take this nomination.<br>

For him, the Marshall had some reservation.<br>
Captain, but that his was slain.<br>
Perhaps this was his means to elevation?<br>

Forth he went to attempt this infiltration.<br>
A lone destroyer, they loosed<br>
Like an arrow to attempt penetration.<br>

And on the way, they glimpsed an invitation!<br>
An uncloaked bomber spying,<br>
So surely this was meant for reclamation!<br>

By hand they plotted, judging estimation,<br>
To hide among the debris.<br>
And in the wrecks they hoped for obfuscation.<br>

With a jolt the dual webs brought domination.<br>
The spy was caught, far from help.<br>
Alone, smitten, free for our confiscation.<br>

The Matar spies squealed at our occupation.<br>
Guns at their heads, they cowered.<br>
To aid or die, this was our proclamation.<br>

They claimed our foes consumed in fornication,<br>
helpless in their libation,<br>
There was no attack; refortification.<br>

Then lest they err, we gave the spies damnation.<br>
We moved to their lines and saw,<br>
Them arming missiles from the Federation.<br>

Their dense sentries ignored our our imitation,<br>
Firing torpedoes, they perished,<br>
Their death throes havoc to their habitation.<br>

But then ahead there was a new temptation.<br>
There sitting alone, unmanned;<br>
Typhoon battleship, feat of aviation.<br>

Abandoning ship at this invitation,<br>
We quickly seized this bounty,<br>
And torched their gay camp in hellish cremation.<br>

In command of this new prize, grand elation!<br>
We flew back toward our own lines,<br>
And all their camp behind was animation.<br>

Escorted now we raced back to our nation.<br>
Our friends rallied ahead in adoration.<br>
The Marshall smiled at morale restoration.<br>
And all about us, a blessed ovation.<br>
