### Victuals
 
Even before, I remember red,<br>
weeping red, like the lone rose<br>
against black plastic.<br>
Too costly, I passed it by.
 
Though at the time it seemed perfect,<br>
I remember now how stubborn aphids<br>
had chewed away at its goodness,<br>
tiny tears in the red petals<br>
and the cluster of thorns on the stem.
 
You loved the red<br>
of a heart eaten raw<br>
lifted to your smiling mouth<br>
your teeth stained<br>
your red rictus<br>
twin lines framing your chin<br>
swiftly drying to a crust.
 
A man more wise<br>
might have known to step around<br>
a cooling pool of blood,<br>
two damp trails leading off<br>
and the grim white reflection.
 
Instead, my toes disturb the almost-dry surface<br>
brush aside the browning skin<br>
to reveal slick and sticky red<br>
coating the tips indelibly.
 
It was nothing. Consumed<br>
by a single gout of red flame,<br>
crumbled to ash.

### Firebird
 
My dead heart lies in sullen ashes, black<br>
like shattered plastic and shame and drift-<br>
ing smoke, dark, vacuous and slowly crack-<br>
ling with almost spent flames, which reach and lift,<br>
sooty claws up walls.

                    The first touches, fum-<br>
bling and beautiful, of love in this place;<br>
blazing caresses in the soft dark, stum-<br>
bling over strange things, like family, fac-<br>
ing forward, or turning back.

                    You pass me<br>
one morning with a smile, and I realise<br>
that my home is your arms and lips and hea-<br>
ving chest. My residence is your burnt eyes.
 
No place can contain this brazen fire,<br>
you stroke these embers, pant and perspire.

### How to make Qatayef

First, the sweet syrup,<br>
sugar water<br>
and tart lime.

Apply heat,<br>
the warmth, the stroke<br>
of flame, the slow build<br>
of anticipation.

Caress<br>
the dough,<br>
keep it wet,<br>
gentle but insistent hands.

Smear<br>
The dough on her dress<br>
As you sidle up behind<br>
Her, her smell of cumin<br>
and cinnamon and her cascades<br>
of soft treacle hair<br>
that you drink<br>
like water in a desert.

Encircling arms drizzle<br>
across bare skin<br>
pale and dusted<br>
with flour.

The syrup bubbles.<br>
Forget the Qatayef as you kiss<br>
her forever.

### The Dream Book

What was that book I lost?<br>
It dripped away<br>
like water in my hands<br>
crawling out of the velvet well.<br>

In the book was a wild green country;<br>
a place I want to take you.<br>
Mountains rise against the blanket<br>
of still murmuring trees -<br>
whose branches stroke and drift<br>
against the silent undergrowth.

We had a journey in that book,<br>
through a high pass, a hawk’s cry<br>
in the sharp air and the hanging snowflakes<br>
at noontime, melted to droplets which muddy<br>
the earth and disappear<br>
underfoot.

I think you wrote the dream book,<br>
sprinkled it on my mind<br>
with a dusting of white-brown feathers<br>
swirling to rest<br>
or scattered by spring winds.

When you said you loved me I never dreamed<br>
that I’d follow you into the purple sleep labyrinth.

My lamp is bright, it leads us beyond.
