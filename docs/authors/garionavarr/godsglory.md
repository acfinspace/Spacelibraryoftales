Ascribe unto God, all you heavenly beings;<br>
ascribe unto God glory and strength.<br>
Ascribe unto God the glory of His holy name;<br>
ascribe unto God the majesty of all Creation.

The voice of God is heard in all the heavens;<br>
the voice of God is heard as great thunder.<br>
The voice of God is a sound of power;<br>
the voice of God conveys majesty by its sound.

The voice of God shatters high mountains;<br>
and makes the wind to strip bare the land.<br>
The voice of God causes the seas to churn;<br>
and great storms to arise on Zorast.

The voice of God is as a light in darkness;<br>
it burns like a bonfire in the depths of night.<br>
The voice of God is the song of Creation;<br>
and all in His temples sing glory.

Our God is enthroned above the whole heavens;<br>
our God is enthroned as ruler forever.<br>
Our God gives strength to His people;<br>
our God blesses His people with peace.
