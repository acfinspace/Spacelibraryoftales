> Entry for YC122 New Eden Capsuleerâ€™s Writing Contest in the Poetry category.


Kaleidoscope nebulas of pink, blue, and purple<br>
dotted over majestic expanses of midnight.<br>
Magic places only seen in my imagination.

Flying faster than light, but hearing no sound.<br>
The rush as my heart beats faster.

Planets, stations, citadels<br>
crisscrossing the immense cluster.<br>
People from all places, clothes, hair, culture.<br>
I want to experience them all with the hunger of a starving soul.

One day I will soar across the stars.<br>
Face the trials of space.<br>
Now I labor to learn, prepare, understand<br>
until my feet can freely leave the ground.
