Circling wildly over the ravaged battlefield,<br>
Glistening black harbingers of death.<br>
Eviscerated corpses,<br>
Casualties of a meaningless war.

Heaving for breath,<br>
Leaning on his sword,<br>
He waits.<br>
He listens.

Collecting the souls of the departed,<br>
He watches their flight,<br>
Head dipped in reverence,<br>
Wondering.

A weary ache besets his body,<br>
Reminding him of his dislike for conflict.<br>
Yet bound by oaths,<br>
He fights on.

Cries of comrades and enemies<br>
Haunt his dreams.<br>
Waking nightmares.<br>
Horrific echoing pleas for mercy, for death.

A flutter of wings,<br>
Sharp talons in his shoulder.<br>
They speak.<br>
They remember.

We are one, they say.<br>
We are one.<br>
Protectors, soldiers,<br>
Harbingers of death.
