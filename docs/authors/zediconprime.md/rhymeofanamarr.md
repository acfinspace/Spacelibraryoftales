Vakhai, vakhid, vamam, vamatalb;<br>
Idi naji e ramud sahibe-u.<br>
A artehs.<br>

Emarr dunija naji emarr taht.<br>
A e manu reshjval-u.<br>

Emarr shlechan larr ard.<br>
A e garla i reshios-u.<br>

Soim chard dula-u, merkez shaife-u, hubra-u,<br>
Itlech noch, chiost, ta riamkh nash veda tesel.<br>

Translation:

To live, to see, to stand, to claim;<br>
This is the way of the Holder.<br>
I am a person who rises.<br>

My world is my throne.<br>
I am the hand of the empress.<br>

My slaves are her fortune.<br>
I am the pride of the empire.<br>

Seed of the gold flower, core of creation, solution of Heaven,<br>
Every moon, planet, and star near knows to give submission.<br>
