I sit behind the glass looking at the snow falling.
The Tengu spirits are still with me.
I sense the cold all–around me, it is a chilly day.
And yet I must make sure this day becomes a warm memory.

The outdoor is as barren as always.
If it was not for the white blanket on everything,
There would be nothing to see.
Despite this, there is life in this cold.

I see the Noxirs on the standing brown brins.
Hunting for their substenance for the day.
The way they hunt is peculiar, under the snow.
Mouth wide open and yet hidden.

A Brirac comes near it, its three sturdy legs holding it.
It bursts through the few branches of the brins.
It must be looking for something.
But the only thing it finds is a predator.

The skies are as cloudy as ever.
I contemplate them, there is a few Liras in it.
Their four sets of wings are not impeded by the snow.
They fly slowly in the white sky.

Gekutami III is famous for its year-long snow storm.
A storm that is gracious, beautiful.
Whose snow is light and crystalline.
But whose cold is no less deadly.

We Achuras, have adapted to those climates.
We settled them.
We no longer fear their cold.
We can just look at it through the glass.

I have to break from my mindlessness.
There will be important things to take care of.
Especially today.
She must be waiting for me.

I kneel, I look at the sky.
I ask the Spirits to be with me.
The Tengus that make them fly.
The Coraxs that make them stand.

The Spirits of the Sky.
The Spirits of the Wind.
The Spirits of the Snow.
The Spirits that are in all things.

I leave the glass, I start to walk.
Along the corridors of our family’s quarters.
I meet several of our servants.
They salute and go aout their business.

The light turns blue, I enter the Thinking rooms.
There, right in front of the aquarium.
This is where I know I will find her.
Only stairs separate me from there.

I go down the stairs, looking straight ahead.
Turn around and she is there.
I walk to meet here, she is not looking.
The Arimes and Messas are floating in the water.

My arms around her shoulders.
She greet them with her hands.
They are chilly, but not cold.
I get my arms around her even more.

“You have been waiting for me?”
“Always,” she answers.
“You always take your time when I’m waiting for you,”
She continues.

She is right.
Do I like the feeling when she waits for me?
I paid my respect to the spiritis.
I did not intend to make her wait.

“I have been missing you though”, I say.
“and I will be missing you even more.”
She turns around, look at my face.
“You have finally taken a decision?”, she says.

I look at her dark, black eyes.

Her raven hair and her pale skin.
I can sense my desire for them.
They fill every part of my being with contentment.

“Yes, I did.” I answer.
“I am glad you finally made your mind”, she tells me.
I cannot sense sadness in her voice, or her eyes.
I am happy for that.

“When will you go ?” She says.
“Tomorrow,” I answer.
“This is our last day.”
She looks concerned.

“We will see each other though,” she says.
“Maybe not tomorrow, but in years?”
I look at her raven black again, hold them.
I have to tell her what will happen.

“Yes, we will.”
“But then I will be very different.”
“I will have died, but I will still be alive.”
I can now see sadness in her eyes.

“But this will be what you wanted?”
She asks, her voice smaller than before.
I cannot lie to her, I will never lie to her.
“Yes.” I tell her.

“The Spirits have called me,”
“They tell me this is the path to know them.”

I continue, “And I cannot refuse their call.”
“Even if I doubt.” I finish.

She looks at me, deep in my eyes.
I can sense she is happy ?
“Will your clone still love me ?”
“Always.” I say.

I hold her close to my heart.
She is not cold, she is the warmest thing in my life.
But the stars are calling.
And they ask for me to gaze at them.
