## Part 1

Mehatoor - 24th IC Station

In an unprecedented move, a capsuleer is being called on for back payments of child support after numerous attempts by the yet-unnamed capsuleer to contact the mother and child.

“He just won’t leave us alone, so I figured, why not? Maybe he does have some connection to her. I still wouldn’t leave her alone with him,” the mother told reporters outside the courtroom after the initial hearing.

The mother claims she had her memories wiped after several traumatic encounters with the father. Still, she believes he is of means to support child and make sure she is brought up according to the proper tenants of the Amarrian Faith.

Little is known about the father, as records in this case are closed due to the minor age of the child, but it can be confirmed he has been ousted as a heretic by the Amarrian Theology Council.

The mother is being represented by the Legal Offices of Alahmed and Rogan. We caught up with the mother’s attorney, Octantia Dadarwar. “While we do not recognize this person’s rights as a citizen of Amarr, we do feel it is the responsibility of all parents to contribute to the upbringing of their children, and make sure they are brought up accordingly in the Faith. And in doing so, he should be made to pay for that upbringing, heretic or not.”

When asked about the mother, Miss Dadarwar brought this additional bit of information to the table, “Once the child is provided for, we will be doing all in our power to make sure this poor woman is compensated for the trauma inflicted on her by this individual. Years have passed since the incident, but we have no statute of limitations on these types of crimes.”

Miss Dadarwar departed without further comment. We will be following this case with interest.

24TH IMPERIAL CRUSADE LOGISTIC SUPPORT, MEHATOOR VI, DEVOID

Responding to a recent legal action seeking payment of child support, infamous capsuleer Nauplius has filed a legal brief of his own demanding sole custody of the child in question. In the brief, hand delivered to the court by a TCMC-programmed slave, Nauplius claims that the child was horrifically abducted shortly after birth by noblewoman Lady Melisande Galena, who faked the baby’s death and emotionally manipulated the distraught mother, Achuran Serena Shi, into ending her marriage to Nauplius and death-cloning away her memories of the relationship. Only then, it is claimed, did Lady Galena return the child to Ms. Shi, hiding from her the true identity of her baby’s father.

In addition to his demands for custody, backed by images and video of he and Ms. Shi together which were submitted along with the brief, Nauplius has demanded independent paternity testing and an injunction against Lady Galena, whom he says has not only manipulated Ms. Shi but failed to protect her against the threat of Minmatar assassins. The brief unusually extends to Ms. Shi an offer of remarriage, promising her a dowry of “at least” 100,000 yaks and 100,000 slaves along with a life of total luxury aboard her very own Victorieux Luxury Yacht and all the resources needed to raise her child in perfect comfort and security. “At least come visit me,” concluded Nauplius in his brief.

Mehatoor - 24th IC Station

Another hearing brought us a fascinating and almost horrifying proposal from the opposing client - an offer of remarriage. When asked about this and the likelihood of acceptance, the claimant turned a vivid shade of green and had to excuse herself from the proceedings.

Miss Dadarwar indicated this was further proof of the traumatic circumstances her client found herself in while under the influence of the respondent. She went on to say that they would be doing all in their power to prevent this respondent having any custody of or visitation with her client’s young daughter, pointing out his many inadequacies as a parent.

We also inquired about the charges laid against Lady Melisandre Galena, who has sheltered the claimant and her daughter since they fled the respondent. Miss Dadarwar had to refrain from laughing at the outrageous contention that ‘minmatar assassins’ were after her client and her client’s daughter.

“The entire concept is beyond humorous, only adding to the mounting evidence of the respondent’s instability. Lady Galena protected my client and did only as asked by my client to rid her of the trauma of the events. Officers of the court have been to see the child, and are completely satisfied with her upbringing. In fact, they are pleased she is being educated in the Faith, as well as other subjects appropriate for an Amarrian child. We are wholly confident in our success in these legal matters, and find it quite a shame that the respondent doesn’t see this is in the best interests of the child.”

24TH IMPERIAL CRUSADE LOGISTIC SUPPORT, MEHATOOR VI, DEVOID

In a shocking development in an ongoing custody battle, notorious capsuleer Nauplius has attempted to backmail his former wife Serena Shi by releasing evidence purporting to show Ms. Shi participating in forbidden Sani Sabik rituals. Among the evidence provided to the court as well as Gallentean reporters covering Mr. Nauplius’s Sedevacantist Church include —

- Sworn affidavits from Mr. Nauplius’s workers and slaves claiming that Ms. Shi sacrificed three Minmatar to God — one Brutor, one Sebiestor, one Vherokior — during an initiation ritual.
- An image of a Sani Sabik style Golden Vial which is said to contain the blood of Ms. Shi’s three Minmatar victims.
- Security camera footage said to show Ms. Shi participating in a “Blood Liturgy” in Mr. Nauplius’s former Red Temple. In the footage, a priest offers Ms. Shi a chalice containing a red liquid, intoning, “The Blood of the Brutor” to which Ms. Shi responds, “It gives strength to the Chosen” before drinking from the cup.

Mr. Nauplius also released a recording addressed to Ms. Shi. This begins by stating that Ms. Shi will now be a wanted criminal in every Empire and has no choice but to seek refuge in the only safe place for her in all the cluster — Mr. Nauplius’s hanger. After apologizing for the release of the incriminating material, Mr. Nauplius says it was for Ms. Shi’s own good and that it was the only way to get Ms. Shi “away from the clutches of the evil Lady Galena.” Mr. Nauplius repeated the “happy things” that await his former wife in his hanger, including a luxury yacht, thousands of slaves, and eventually remarriage with a wedding gift including at least 100,000 yaks. “Please come home, before it is too late,” Mr. Nauplius concluded his message.

## Part 5

Mehatoor - 24th IC Station

The hearing continues…

After a thorough psychological investigation lasting several weeks, sparked by the ‘evidence’ presented by the respondent, the court has come to several medical conclusions regarding the mental state of the claimant while under the influence of the respondent.

The appointed guardian of the claimant had provided to the court saved medical data files, stating that she retained the information in the event such allegations would come to light. Speaking anonymously to this reporter, the lady informed us that she knew the respondent to be a harmful and dangerous man, and did all in her power to protect the claimant. In this reporter’s opinion, an admirable and loyal lady.

While the records will remain confidential for the privacy of the claimant, the court determined that she had been manipulated by the respondent to the point of near mental breakdown, and as such, the allegations laid forth by the respondent are viewed as slanderous.

“We are immensely pleased by the court’s conclusion,” Miss Dadarwar stated to reporters after the ruling by the court. “We hope now the respondent will recognize his futile attempts at further damaging my client’s mental health will not go unpunished.”

When asked about the actions of the claimant while under the unholy influences of the respondent, Miss Dadarwar stated, “We have seen time and again the instability of the respondent. His delusions surely do not make him a fit parent for any child, seeing as he had to manipulate the claimant in order to impregnant her. My client is no more a criminal than you or I. In fact, she should be viewed as another victim in the respondent’s terroristic vendetta against the holy Empire.”

In reference to the respondent’s proposal of remarriage, Miss Dadarwar was very succinct. “Would you force an abuse victim to marry their abuser? I think not.”
