I am pleased to announce the TENTH year for a writing contest for stories or poems by or about Capsuleers/Baseliners and their worlds and cultures.

## Rules

There will be three categories this year:

- Poetry
- Prose
- Other: Academic/Scientific (e.g. Academic, Economic Reports, Science Reports, Theological Writings, Treatises, etc.) or News/Gossip/Opinion Pieces

DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION - MAY 31st

There is no minimum length. Maximum length is 5,000 words. There is no required subject matter; the content may be fiction or non-fiction.

Prior works are eligible as long as posted or published AFTER May 15, YC 124 (2022). This means, for example, works in the recent story-time thread on the IGS or stories and gossip reports (in Player Fiction) in the past year can be nominated by their authors for consideration.

Please post entries by linking in this thread or by a clear label in the Eve Fiction category of these forums, e.g. [YC 124 NEWCWC your work title here] as the title.

### Additional rules/comments

Each of the Judges may, in their discretion, award a personal prize to the favorite (regardless of the “place” of the submission)

The most “amusing” or “entertaining” to me* or intriguing gets treated to a candlelit dinner by me at a fine restaurant or a meal at another location and a Stratios Galnet Streamcast Unit SKIN!

All judges and I (as administrator) are disqualified from submission for prizes.

All entries will be considered. However, no plagarism is allowed. The work must be the original work of the author.

if the quality of the entries does not merit the number of prizes, then prizes will be given up to the number deemed meritorious.

if people have any questions or need rulings, I am the contest administrator and you can feel free to message me directly.

Also a thank you to this year’s panel of judges for volunteering their time and efforts: Loai Qerl, Nevyn Kumamato, Cassandra Habulu, Pol Macsliebh,Henrik Suzaku, Kaladote Lafisques, Bin Orlenard and Shaikar.

A thank you also to our donors so far this year, Arrendis, Kaladote Lafisques, Valerie Valate, Ushra’Khan, and ARC.

Cordially, and with God’s Blessings
