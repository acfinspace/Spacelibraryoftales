### Additional rules/comments

Each of the Judges may, in their discretion, award a personal prize to the favorite (regardless of the “place” of the submission)

The most “amusing” or “entertaining” to me* or intriguing gets treated to a candlelit dinner by me at a fine restaurant or a meal at another location and a Stratios Galnet Streamcast Unit SKIN!

All judges and I (as administrator) are disqualified from submission for prizes.

All entries will be considered. However, no plagarism is allowed. The work must be the original work of the author.

if the quality of the entries does not merit the number of prizes, then prizes will be given up to the number deemed meritorious.

if people have any questions or need rulings, I am the contest administrator and you can feel free to message me directly.

Also a thank you to this year’s panel of judges for volunteering their time and efforts: Loai Qerl, Nevyn Kumamato, Cassandra Habulu, Pol Macsliebh,Henrik Suzaku, Kaladote Lafisques, Bin Orlenard and Shaikar.

A thank you also to our donors so far this year, Arrendis, Kaladote Lafisques, Valerie Valate, Ushra’Khan, and ARC.

Cordially, and with God’s Blessings
