# YC124 New Eden Capsuleers Writing Contest (2022)

In light of the successful contest the last eight years I am pleased to announce the NINTH (yay!) year for a writing contest for stories or poems by or about Capsuleers/Baseliners and their worlds and cultures.

## Rules

There is no minimum length. Maximum length is 15,000 words. There is no required subject matter; the content may be fiction or non-fiction.

Prior works are eligible as long as posted or published AFTER May 15, YC 123 (2021). This means, for example, works in the recent story-time thread on the IGS or stories and gossip reports (in Player Fiction) in the past year can be nominated by their authors for consideration.

Please post entries by linking in this thread or by a clear label in the Eve Fiction category of these forums, e.g. [YC 124 NEWCWC your work title here] as the title.

Judges: bLoai Qerl, Maira Blackfire, Korsavius, Clementine Lafleur, Nevyn Kumamato, Cassandra Habulu, Pol Macsliebh, and Bin Orlenard.

ADDITIONAL RULES/COMMENTS

All judges and I (as administrator) are disqualified from submission for prizes.

All entries will be considered. However, no plagarism is allowed.

if the quality of the entries does not merit the number of prizes, then prizes will be given up to the number deemed meritorious.

if people have any questions or need rulings, I am the contest administrator and you can feel free to message me directly.

((OOC note - no plagarism! it is requested that the work be “original” to the player entering and not copied from another author.))
