# YC123 Union Day Celebrations - Short Written Works Contest (2021)

In celebration and honour of the YC123 Union Day the LUMEN Caldari Contingent is sponsoring a writing contest for inspiring and patriotic written works in the form of short prose or classic poetry.

This event is open to Citizens and non-citizens alike*. The purpose of the contest is to celebrate and illuminate the culture, history, achievements, future, and way of life of the Caldari people, the State, and the client states. Entries should reflect that.
We are defined by who we are, what we do and what we achieve, not by who we are not, nor who we fight against. Please do keep that in mind for these entries as well.

The entries shall be no longer than 1000 words, there is no minimal length.

## Rules and limitations:

- The intent is that works submitted to this contest are made for Union Day YC123. As such, already existing works should not be entered (This is waivered for works published relatively recently).
- Multiple submissions from the same person is allowed, each entry is judged separately.
- I reserve the right to disqualify any hostile or inappropriate entry or contestant.
- All judges are disqualified from submitting works to the contest.
