# YC122 New Eden Capsuleers Writing Contest (2020)

Original post: [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/yc-122-new-eden-capsuleers-writing-contest/223209](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/yc-122-new-eden-capsuleers-writing-contest/223209)

In light of the successful contest the last six years I am pleased to announce the SEVENTH (yay!) year for a writing contest for stories or poems by or about Capsuleers/Baseliners and their worlds and cultures.

## Rules

DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION - MAY 15th 2020

There is no minimum length. Maximum length is 30,000 words. There is no required subject matter; the content may be fiction or non-fiction. Prior works are eligible as long as posted or published AFTER May 15, YC 121 (2019). This means, for example, works in the recent story-time thread on the IGS can be nominated by their authors for consideration.

Please post entries by linking in this thread or by a clear label in the Eve Fiction category of these forums, e.g. [YC 122 NEWCWC your work title here] as the title.

JUDGES:
Loai Qerl<br>
Pol Macsliebh<br>
Francophobia<br>
Valdezi<br>
Haria Haritimado<br>
Tessande Falconer<br>
Lightnin Lemmont

### Prizes

FIRST PLACE - 5 billion isk<br>
SECOND PLACE - 3 billion isk<br>
THIRD PLACE - 750 million isk<br>
FOURTH PLACE - 250 million isk<br>
Honorable Mentions - 50 million isk<br>
(Rolled over from last year - an anonymous donation. Another 5.5 billion received from Arc! 5 Billion from Francophobia! Other Sponsors Welcome and Needed!)

SPECIAL PRIZES:

Each of the Judges may, in their discretion, award a personal prize to the favorite (regardless of the “place” of the submission)

The most “amusing” or “entertaining” to me* or intriguing gets treated to a candlelit dinner by me at a fine restaurant

### Additional rules/comments

All judges and I (as administrator) are disqualified from submission for prizes.

All entries will be considered.

if the quality of the entries does not merit the number of prizes, then prizes will be given up to the number deemed meritorious.

if people have any questions or need rulings, I am the contest administrator and you can feel free to message me directly.

Cordially, and with God’s Blessings
