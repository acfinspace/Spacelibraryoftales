# YC121 New Eden Capsuleers Writing Contest (2019)

In light of the successful contest the last five years I am pleased to announce the SIXTH (yay!) year for a writing contest for stories or poems by Capsuleers .

## Rules

There will be three categories:

Poetry
Prose
Academic/News (e.g. Academic, News Reporting, Economic Reports, Science Reports, Theological Writings, Treatises, etc.)
There will be a total of at least seven judges, who will judge ALL categories:

Loai Qerl
Arrendis
Pol Macsliebh
Laisariona Raske
Annabella Rella
Francophobia

There is no minimum length. Maximum length is 30,000 words. There is no required subject matter; the content may be fiction or non-fiction. All entries will be considered.

Submissions are to be made by posting on either

Eve Forums - Fiction Portal - Player Fiction
https://forums.eveonline.com/c/fiction-portal/fiction 22

or Backstage - Eve Fiction Board
http://backstage.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?board=6.0 10

While not required, it helps me track entries if you do start your title [YC 121 NECWC] or something similar. Regardless, Your post should specifically reference at the outset that it is being submitted for consideration in the YC 121 New Eden Capsuleer’s Writing Contest. If you have a good reason why you want to make a private submission, then contact me privately as to why.

DEADLINE for submissions is MAY 15TH of this year.

ADDITIONAL RULES/COMMENTS

All judges and I (as administrator) are disqualified from submission.

All entries will be considered.

if the quality of the entries does not merit the number of prizes, then prizes will be given up to the number deemed meritorious.

if people have any questions or need rulings, I am the contest administrator and you can feel free to message me directly.

Cordially, and with God’s Blessings
