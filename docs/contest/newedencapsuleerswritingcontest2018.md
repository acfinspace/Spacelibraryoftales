There is no minimum length. Maximum length is 30,000 words. There is no required subject matter; the content may be fiction or non-fiction. All entries will be considered. Submissions are to be made by posting on Eve Forums - Eve Fiction or on http://backstage.eve-inspiracy.com 25 . Your post should specifically reference at the outset that it is being submitted for consideration in the YC 120 New Eden Capsuleer’s Writing Contest. If you have a good reason why you want to make a private submission, then contact me privately as to why.

DEADLINE for submissions is MAY 30TH of this year.


ADDITIONAL RULES/COMMENTS

All judges and I (as administrator) are disqualified from submission.

All entries will be considered.

if the quality of the entries does not merit the number of prizes, then prizes will be given up to the number deemed meritorious.

if people have any questions or need rulings, I am the contest administrator and you can feel free to message me directly.

Cordially, and with God’s Blessings
