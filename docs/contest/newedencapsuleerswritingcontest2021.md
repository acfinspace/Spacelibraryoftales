Original post: [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/yc-123-new-eden-capsuleers-writing-contest/298106](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/yc-123-new-eden-capsuleers-writing-contest/298106)

In light of the successful contest the last seven years I am pleased to announce the EIGHTH (yay!) year for a writing contest for stories or poems by or about Capsuleers/Baseliners and their worlds and cultures.

## Rules

DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION - MAY 15th 2021

There is no minimum length. Maximum length is 15,000 words. There is no required subject matter; the content may be fiction or non-fiction.

Prior works are eligible as long as posted or published AFTER May 15, YC 122 (2020). This means, for example, works in the recent story-time thread on the IGS or stories and gossip reports (in Player Fiction) in the past uear can be nominated by their authors for consideration.

Please post entries by linking in this thread or by a clear label in the Eve Fiction category of these forums, e.g. [YC 123 NEWCWC your work title here] as the title.

### Prizes

FIRST PLACE - 5 billion isk<br>
SECOND PLACE - 3 billion isk<br>
THIRD PLACE - 750 million isk<br>
FOURTH PLACE - 250 million isk<br>
Honorable Mentions - 50 million isk

SPECIAL PRIZES:

Each of the Judges may, in their discretion, award a personal prize to the favorite (regardless of the “place” of the submission)

There is also a prize, for the Academic Category, “of up to 1 billion ISK, in the acadenic category, for the best article featuring archaeology or cheese” sponsored by Dr. Valerie Valate.

The most “amusing” or “entertaining” to me* or intriguing gets treated to a candlelit dinner by me at a fine restaurant or a meal at another location

### Additional rules/comments

All judges and I (as administrator) are disqualified from submission for prizes.

All entries will be considered. However, no plagarism is allowed.

if the quality of the entries does not merit the number of prizes, then prizes will be given up to the number deemed meritorious.

if people have any questions or need rulings, I am the contest administrator and you can feel free to message me directly.

I also want to offer the following thank you to our Donors! Franco Phonaga (15 billion isk), ARC (2 billion isk), Maira Blackfire (2 billion isk), Josephine Andere (2 billion isk), a former winner of the contest Tanagura Amoii (1 billion isk), Gosakumori Noh (1 billion isk), and Nix Pardus. Dr. Valerie Valate has also sponsored 1 billion isk for the best article in the academic category featuring archaeology or cheese

Also a thank you to this year’s panel of judges for volunteering their time and efforts: Arsia Elkin, Cain Aloga, Franco Phonaga, Kalodote Lafisques, Lasairiona Raske, Lightning Lemmont, Loai Qerl, Maira Blackfire, and Valdezi
